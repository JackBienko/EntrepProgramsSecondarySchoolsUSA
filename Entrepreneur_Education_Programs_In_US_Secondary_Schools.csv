Abstract: The Youth Entrepreneurial Academy (YEA) was a six-week program that introduced participants to the entrepreneurial concept, covering such areas as the business plan, keeping records, marketing, etc. We covered the 12 modules in The New Youth Entrepreneur, published by the Kauffman Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership and EDTEC.

The students were ages 15–19, and were working on their GEDs, high school diplomas, or college degrees. The instructor was a business owner for more than 23 years (—The National Inner City (weekly newspaper), Inner City Printers, C. W. Porter Consulting). He is a certified entrepreneurial educator with a bachelor's degree and two master's degrees.

Businesspeople and experts in most of the areas addressed the sessions. Field trips included tours of local businesses and a trip to the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and Alabama State University in Montgomery. The youth entrepreneurs were exposed to every offering available that pertained to entrepreneurship; including SBA–sponsored workshops, participating in a university-level class in entrepreneurial education.

At least three participants have immediate plans for after-school business startups. All participants plan to complete college and to work in their areas of business interest prior to starting serious ventures.

AL,Shoals Entrepreneurial Center,Shoals Entrepreneurial Center: Home,"Focus: Our mission is to provide young businesses a sheltered environment for developing the management, financial, and technical skills necessary to become self-sustaining members of the business community.

Geographic Area: Five-county area in Northwest Alabama.

Products and Services: Provides start-up and expanding small businesses space, shared equipment, on-site consulting, entrepreneurial training, and other shared services such as mailing and shipping, library, and conference room.

Federal Partners: ARC, TVA, USDA, EDA, and ISTEA.

Abstract: The Shoals Entrepreneurial Center (SEC) is a business incubator with sites in Sheffield, Florence Industrial Park, and a new kitchen incubator in downtown Florence. The center has had 82 clients, 74 of which are still in business. The center has had 31 graduates and has a job creation total of 856. These numbers do not include the Shoals Commercial Culinary Center.

SEC has taken on various entrepreneurial education activities in addition to its above-described purpose. Most of the following could not have been accomplished without the assistance of the Appalachian Regional Commission.

Historically, most people in Northwest Alabama have grown up with the idea that they were going to work for an employer. In order to create an infrastructure for encouraging entrepreneurship, it was imperative for the SEC to initiate an educational campaign for its citizens. The following characterizes some SEC activities to promote entrepreneurial events on an ongoing basis:

Entrepreneurship presentations in various school systems and colleges
Booths at school career day
Booths at local Chamber Mart
Host visits from school entrepreneurial classes
Host visits from Youth Leadership Shoals
In regard to past activities, SEC held a one-day, five-hour Youth Entrepreneurship Training Workshop on the campus of the University of North Alabama, which was attended by over 120 eleventh grade students from Lauderdale, Colbert, Franklin, Marion and Winston Counties. Thirty-two out of the thirty-five area schools participated. Preceding the conference, students completed a pretest questionnaire on entrepreneurial attitudes, knowledge and behavior. At the conclusion of the conference, tests were administered, and a final post-test was administered a few months later.

SEC held a second training workshop the following year, which was attended by 108 junior and senior high school students. SEC has produced both radio and television Public Service Announcements that promote youth entrepreneurship. A media blitz, promoting entrepreneurial awareness, both preceded and followed each of the workshops. SEC videotaped and edited each of the YEC workshops. Copies were sent to all area schools to keep in their libraries or to use in business classes.

The University of North Alabama School of Business agreed to take on the YEC program and they had a successful third year and are working on the program for the forth year.

Shoals Entrepreneurial Center obtained grant monies and partnered with Pacer Cooperative/REAL Enterprises, Inc. to present a hands-on entrepreneurship course, already developed and tested, to two rural area high schools, Lauderdale County and Waterloo High School. The course leads students through the actual establishment of a small business of their own design. This provided training for the students and for the teachers involved who will then be committed to passing that training on to other teachers and students.

SEC, in coordination with the Northwest Shoals Community College, filmed, edited, and aired a program presented by students of Lauderdale County High Schools Pacer /REAL program. These students also, presented a program at this year Youth Entrepreneurial Workshop.

To further broaden the entrepreneurial infrastructure of our area, the SEC has worked on and subcontracted parts of a training workbook titled ""How to Start Your Own Business"" as well as a Shoals Area Small Business Resource Guide. The training workbook is accessible in hard copy, on CD, and through our web site at http://www.shoalsec.com. The Resource Guide is available in hard copy only. SEC also developed a video featuring successful area entrepreneurs, which has aired numerous times on the NWSCC cable channel.

We are presently partnering with the local SBDC to develop and distribute a newsletter to any interested business across SBDC's 7 county area that provides an up-to-date calendar of events and information that affects small businesses.

SEC has purchased an entrepreneurial training tape series that will be aired on NWSCC cable channel for course credit, continuing education, and general awareness."

Entrepreneurship—Opportunities for the New Millennium",none listed,"Focus: Four-year university

Abstract: To encourage potential entrepreneurs, SAU faculty and students formed a project team focusing on entrepreneurship. The project team developed a project: ""Entrepreneurship—Opportunities for the New Millennium."" The project has four phases:


1.  Media concentration: to educate listening audience (using cablevision, PSAs on radio stations, newspaper articles)

2.  Web page class: for hands-on development

3.  Workshop: to educate potential entrepreneurs (partnered with Small Business Development Center)

4.  Teach a Child about Business project: for hands-on development for children.
Media Concentration: The project team developed a seven-part cablevision series addressing issues such as how to get started in business, what issues new business owners might face, how to finance a new business, what ethical dilemmas might                           arise, how economic markets operate, and when to internationalize operations. Working with local entrepreneurs, the project team offered a variety of experienced-based cablevision programs to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit in potential business owners. Panel discussions were taped and aired on the local cablevision station. Entrepreneurs discussed their experiences and what they have learned about finance, ethics, taxes, responsible risk taking, and decision making. Student moderators focused on business issues by visiting with:

Minority entrepreneurs during February for Black History Month
Women entrepreneurs in real estate, law, and dentistry during March for Women's History
Women entrepreneurs in retail during March for Women's History Month
Young entrepreneurs (those under the age of 30) during March
Professors and bankers on economic issues during March
CEO, attorney, and dean of School of Business on ethical dilemmas during April
Executive in Residence on international issues during April
Web Page Class: The project team taught a class on Web page design. Entrepreneurs and small businesses can take advantage of the huge potential of the Internet by having their own Web page. The project team discussed e-commerce, taught the basics of Microsoft FrontPage, and created a hands-on approach to developing their own Web pages.

Workshop: The project team partnered with the Small Business Development Center to present a workshop, ""So You Want to Start Your Own Business."" The project team discussed key issues to help potential entrepreneurs understand the major steps considered crucial in starting a business; identified common factors as potential entrepreneurs plan their businesses; and provided take-home material as a resource to help answer other questions not addressed.

Teach a Child about Business Week Project The project team designed a hands-on project working with first and second graders. During ""Teach a Child about Business Week,"" the project team taught the children how businesses operate. Working with a local entrepreneur, the project team explained business concepts to the students and worked with them to create their own business. The elementary students did market research, prepared a business plan, secured a loan, made business decisions, ordered inventory, delivered the product, and decided what to do with profit. The product the students chose to sell was a carnation with a Valentine's Day message, tied with ribbons."
AZ,Arizona State University West,http://www.west.asu.edu/leep,"Focus: The Leadership for Educational Entrepreneurs (LEE) program is the first program in the nation to offer a graduate degree that blends courses from M.Ed. and MBA programs.

Abstract: Charter schools are independently run institutions funded by public money. A new breed of educational leaders heads these innovative schools. Business people are becoming educational leaders and educational leaders are becoming business people. Their leadership needs differ greatly from traditional aspiring school administrators, and LEE can provide resources and networks to meet those needs.

During the past few years, LEE has built a partnership of charter school and university leaders to develop a dynamic educational-management Masters degree for aspiring school administrators working in a market-based environment. The program is delivered through multiple methods: face-to-face, on-line and at regional sites. LEE includes eight (8) M.Ed. courses and four (4) MBA courses, one course at a time. Fellows design their own action research projects directly related to their individual interests and participate in a hands-on internship program.

This interdisciplinary union is notable because it moves beyond the boundaries of school-university partnerships traditionally focusing on teacher education and K-12 student programs.

Findings show that charter school owner/operators need a complex combination of pedagogical and entrepreneurial skills to provide a positive impact on student learning, maintain fiduciary responsibility to public monies, and excel in a market-based educational system. Critical issues such as assessment and accountability, instructional leadership, and financial management are addressed in this fast-track Master's program.

Small Business Management (Entrepreneurship)",www.cac.cc.az.us,"Focus: As a community college, we use three modalities:

1.  Traditional college classroom setting
2.  Online delivery for adults throughout Arizona and the United States
3.  Instruction for inmates at the Arizona State Prison

Abstract: The Small Business Development Program requires unique teaching methods and paradigms for each of the three delivery modes, although class outcomes, competencies, and syllabi are similar, assuring that the education is standardized across the delivery methods.

This program is designed to encourage students to set up and successfully manage their own small businesses. At the beginning of the semester the students select a business, either fictional or real, that they wish to develop. Over the next 16 weeks the students develop their business one step at a time, following the topics addressed in the textbook, online research, and/or lectures. Assignments are given to assist the student in putting each section of their business, and corresponding business plan, together.

By the end of the semester, the students will have completed a business plan, which will be submitted as their final project. Hopefully the students will use this business plan to successfully open their businesses. I have had many students actually begin their business during the class, and some are still ""surviving"" in these businesses.

One of the most unique features of my program is the high rate of online students who want to start their home-based business while at home with children. They otherwise would not have the chance to get this education. These students are anxious to try to succeed when most ""normal"" opportunities are not available to them because of family or time commitments.

Another unique feature is the opportunity to work with the inmates. These students will have a very difficult time finding employment upon their release, and have plenty of time to work on developing their own business ideas while incarcerated. These inmate students are anxious to learn and eager to begin their business plans. The idea of working for themselves is very exciting to them, and most of them have the knowledge and dedication to prove that they can be successful on their own."

Geographic Area: California and Washington, DC

Age Level: High school students, 9th through 12th grades.

Abstract: All BUILD students participate in the following four-year program:

  Freshman Year - Entrepreneurs 1 (E1): Ninth-grade students meet with BUILD 7-10 hours per week for the entire academic year. In a credited, in-school elective with weekly evening mentoring sessions, students learn the fundamentals of business, the tenets of time management, goal-setting, and effective communication. Teams of 3-5 students develop 20- to 30-page business plans and supporting financials, with the assistance of volunteer mentors from the local professional community. They present and defend these plans at BUILD's Annual Youth Business Plan Competitions. There is no GPA requirement to enter BUILD.
  Sophomore Year - Entrepreneurs 2 (E2): Students meet after-school in BUILD's Youth Business and Academic Incubator for 3-6 hours per week for the academic year. With guidance from a volunteer Venture Capital Advisor, teams operate their small businesses while learning negotiations, business ethics, and more. Students work with BUILD's Academic Program Manager to ensure academic records suitable for college admission. To stay in BUILD, sophomores must begin to maintain a 2.0 GPA.
  Junior Year - Entrepreneurs 3 (E3): While still operating their businesses, students learn topics relating to college, including essay writing, interviewing, financial aid and standardized test preparation. Last year, BUILD students improved their SAT scores by an average of 337 points. BUILD organizes and leads students on local, state, and national college tours. To remain in BUILD, juniors must begin to maintain a 2.5 GPA.
  Senior Year - Entrepreneurs 4 (E4): Students' focus shifts from running businesses to applying to colleges. With the help of BUILD's College Advisor, they identify ""stretch"" and ""safety"" schools, write admissions essays, prepare college applications, and package their BUILD experience into portfolios. BUILD collaborates with parents/guardians to explore students' scholarship and financial-aid options and shepherds them through the school selection and enrollment processes.
To date, 100% of BUILD's seniors have graduated from high school and been accepted into a wide range of colleges and universities including Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, Emory, Wesleyan, UC Berkeley and Willamette, among others. Since our founding, we have served nearly a thousand students.

BUILD's goal is to empower more students from under-resourced communities to graduate from high school and access higher education. BUILD believes that all youth have the potential to be academic performers when given the right motivation, role modeling and instructional strategies."

Over 50% of the students are eligible of the free federal food program.

Entrepreneurship is taught within my 12th grade economics classes. There are two long-term projects. One is the Econ Variety Show, Inc. that attempts to expose students to entrepreneurship and the free enterprise system in an experiential, creative, and student-centered way. Students choose from five different modalities (Research, Tutorial, Video, Technology, and Song) in which they acquire the skills and knowledge of entrepreneurial topics and present them in a formalized setting. The tutorial project involves students teaching concepts of entrepreneurship to local classes within school that feed into the school.

The other project, CAMS Inventors, Inc., is designed to give students a direct experience in developing a Start-Up company where the create an original product/service with an accompanying professional business plan, marketing and advertising, and a culminating event of a Business Convention.

The twin projects have been recognized as excellent entrepreneurship opportunities for high school students. They have both been presented at conferences (CASET, Entrepreneurship Education Forum, GATE) and showcased in USA-Today. Both projects are experiential in nature as students are allowed to freely choose areas to research and make presentations.

CA,"California State Polytechnic University, Pomona,",none listed,"Focus: The area of program emphasis is a university economic development program in partnership with community-based and private-sector organizations.

Abstract: The Small Business Mentor Program is an alliance with university affiliations and community-based and private-sector organizations. This combination of contributing entities brings about a rare blend of practical experience, institutional research, and community economic development, all focused on the revitalization of entrepreneurial businesses.

The target communities are low- and moderate-income, directly affected by small businesses in or immediately adjacent to them. Many of these businesses can be categorized as ""low risk"" due to a high level of compentency in a trade or service; however, they are ""high risk"" often due to a lack of business and financial management knowledge. These businesses often fail to grow, and some collapse. Business failures resulting from a lack of business and financial skills contribute to neighborhood economic blight, impeding community development.

A unique feature of the Small Business Mentor Program is that it provides personal and consistent guidance through mentors and integrated educational materials built on the fundamentals of small-business management. The content and structure of the program use the theory of multiple intelligences. This is not a ""return"" to the classroom program; rather, the Small Business Mentor Program is an ""incubator without walls."" Due to the one-on-one working relationship with the business owners, it is critical that the mentors, instructors, and service providers are sensitive to the fact that each individual learns differently; therefore, the multiple intelligences approach has been implemented.

The philosophy, as well as the organization, of the Small Business Mentor Program becomes more important when working in communities with a dominant ethnic population. Presently the target areas served by the Small Business Mentor Program have a substantial number of Hispanic business owners who qualify for the benefits of the program.

CA,Juma Ventures,www.juma.org,"Focus: Business experiences for youths

Abstract: ""Juma"" translates to ""work"" in Akan. Founded in 1994 with a single Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream shop franchise in San Francisco that provided a handful of job opportunities to homeless youth, Juma Ventures has since become widely regarded as one of the leading social enterprise and youth development programs in the U.S. While we no longer own the ice cream shops, Juma runs successful enterprises at AT&T Park, Monster Park and the Oakland Coliseum, selling ice cream and coffee during baseball and football games. In 2007 we increased our East Bay presence adding the CAL Bears (UC Berkeley football) to our portfolio. In addition, we also successfully expanded beyond the Bay Area to San Diego where we manage a Dreyer's ice cream store as well as several concessions carts for the San Diego Chargers and San Diego State Aztecs at Qualcomm Stadium. In 2008, we expanded our program to the Nationals stadium in Washington DC.

In the early 1990's, Juma's founder, Diane Flannery, was the director of a nonprofit program for homeless youth in San Francisco. During her tenure there, Diane had seen countless numbers of youth get caught up in the same unfortunate cycle - they'd come into the program, receive basic services and counseling, and eventually be placed in entry-level jobs. And, all too frequently, they'd lose their jobs and return to the streets. Seeing this, Diane developed the idea to start a business that could successfully employ and train these young people. The vision was to provide work experience that created stability in these young people's lives, helping them build the skills and self-confidence needed to move forward toward college, better jobs and brighter futures. Armed with that vision, Juma Ventures was born.

In 2003 with a Ben & Jerry's ice cream shop franchise in San Francisco, Juma Ventures has since become widely respected as one of the leading social enterprise and youth development programs in the U.S. Since those early days, our program has evolved considerably, to include both social enterprises where teens receive employment opportunities and a focused set of support services that complement the experience youth receive on the job, preparing them for transitions to college and career paths when they finish high school. Today, Juma is focused on developing opportunities to scale our work, in order to expand our impact with youth and create a model that informs the work of other organizations in the nonprofit sector.

While Juma originally started as a job training and placement program, in 2006, we have refocused our youth transition outcome to successful college enrollment and retention. Since then, we have complemented our successful job skills training and employment services with comprehensive after school programming that includes college and career prep, tutoring, financial literacy education, small business and asset building resources.

In 1999, Juma was the first youth program to develop and offer financial literacy education and asset-building services to teens, where youth build financial knowledge, save for college, small business, and other expenses, and receive matching funds through Individual Development Accounts (IDAs). Today, Juma runs one of the largest youth IDA program in the U.S., with 550 accounts opened and more than $500,000 saved. And, because we generate 30% of our annual budget through earned revenue, we operate more efficiently than comparable youth development programs. In a recent annual evaluation report, the City of San Francisco (DCYF) called Juma, ""One of the most cost-effective programs in the city that has a strong, positive impact on the lives of its youth participants."""

Abstract: Abstract: B-School for Beginners, established in 1996, is a unique graduate course to give teachers methods, materials, and motivation to create and implement entrepreneurship programs in their elementary classrooms. The course equips teachers to help students view entrepreneurship as a viable career option.. Teachers earn two graduate credits when they complete an implementation portfolio that includes a plan for implementing a class or school-wide entrepreneurship project. A third credit can be earned when students evaluate their plan after using it with their students.

The course is unique in that the week-long academy teaches through the use of modeling the strategies used to teach entrepreneurship. Community entrepreneurs share their expertise in lunchtime seminars. An ""entrepreneur tour"" helps teacher see the impact of making the community an extension of the classroom. Participants receive a number of children's books and learn to use literature to teach entrepreneurship, an effective way to introduce teachers to entrepreneurship. Teachers receive and are trained to use ""Inventor's Portfolio"" to incorporate entrepreneurship, invention, creative problem solving, and evaluation into the curriculum. Participants take part in a market to experience being entrepreneurs and to understand the power of a market as a learning experience. Teachers better understand concepts when they use the market as a tool in learning what their elementary students will experience in student ventures.

Effective and significant are the quarterly follow-up dinner meetings that provide mentoring and support for teachers. Teachers receive a new set of lessons at each session and have time to network and share materials and resources. Participating teachers are invited to bring student entrepreneurs to the spring Youth Market, which draws children from across the county."

Geographic Area: New Castle County, Delaware

Age Level: Children (grades 4–6)

Key Partners: Center for Economic Education and Entrepreneurship at University of Delaware, Claymont Business Owners Association, MBNA, Wilmington Trust Bank

Abstract: Hear about Green Street Works, a unique program created for Claymont Elementary School. The school is the first in the state to employ a specialist in entrepreneurship/economic education. All children enrolled in the school attend a weekly entrepreneurship/economic class. Higher-level thinking and creative problem-solving skills are woven into the program. Students apply their entrepreneurial lessons in quarterly school markets, where the competition for the U.S. dollar vote is fierce. Also, each school day provides additional venture opportunities for the young entrepreneurs.

The children earn points for positive workforce behaviors, including good attendance, appropriate dress, and good behavior, preparation, and effort. These points are the only medium of exchange in the Green Street Market, which is staffed and stocked by students. This market serves both as an incentive and as a learning tool for classroom studies.

A major Delaware bank has opened a branch at the school. Children learn how to open accounts and make deposits. Students serve as junior tellers, working with customers and preparing the deposits for the bank.

Claymont Elementary School is the first school to open in the community in over 20 years. A key to the success of the program has been the involvement of the staff in the community and its organizations. These associations have enabled us to form partnerships with Claymont's small businesses, providing donated products for our Green Street Market, mentoring, and job shadowing experiences.

Ronni Cohen designed Green Street Works to motivate the reluctant learner as well as the eager student. The program enables children to connect school to the world of work, to explore both ""making a job"" as well as ""taking a job."" Students solve relevant, real-world problems while they apply basic skills. The faculty is committed to ""empowering students to excel"" through an emphasis on basic skills and the opportunity to apply these critical skills in relevant, hands-on, learning experiences exploring venture awareness, exploration, and creation.

Claymont is the first model school in economics/entrepreneurship and banking in the Center for Economic Education and Entrepreneurship's School-to-Work program. The school will have a monthly visiting/debriefing day for educators interested in observing or replicating the program."
DE,DE Autistic Program,none listed,"Focus: Students with Disabilities, age 14 - 21

Abstract: Learn about activities that teach students with disabilities the critical skills necessary to succeed as entrepreneurs and consumers. There are few programs available which promote the concept that all students ages 14 to 21 can be successful in the world of work. Community entrepreneurs constantly tell educators to teach the 'soft"" skills to the students and the businesses will teach how to perform the tasks. The program presented involves establishing three mini-businesses within the school and the functional skills incorporated into these activities.

THE SCHOOL STORE Students prepare items to sell at the 'school' store 2-3 times a week. Staff and all the students in the school are allowed to make purchases from the 'store'. Many of the students earn the money (real money not simulated or pictures) to buy the items. Parents or community merchants donate some of the items marketed. The students also bake goods, e.g. (The Original Girl Scout Cookie, circa 1922), or make items such as fire place starters and bird feeders.

THE OFFICE STORE Work forms are located in a designated area of the school. Staff members complete the forms and attach them to the clerical or assembly work they want done by the students. The work is placed on shelves that identify what work needs to get done. Students learn to perform all kinds of clerical tasks that also develop functional skills.

FRIDAY LUNCH SPECIAL Students prepare specialty lunches for building staff one day a week. At the beginning of the week all staff members are notified by e-mail regarding the lunch menu and cost. The menu and order forms are posted outside the classroom. Persons wishing to purchase lunches complete the forms and return them to a designated area before mid-week.

The work readiness skills that are being taught stress the importance of increasing the accuracy, rate, independence and duration of student performance within age appropriate activities.

Teresa J Wells has worked with students with disabilities for over twenty years as a teacher in New York, Texas and Delaware. For twelve years she was an Educational Diagnostician working with high school students having mild to moderate disabilities.

Her most recent books are manuals for staff members and parents designed to teach critical skills to students within specific activities.

By providing meaningful vocational training experiences for students with severe and multiple disabilities 62% of these students have transitioned to adult services with employment. After five years 92% of these individuals continue to be employed. Although she retired from the Delaware Autistic Program she continues to work with teachers throughout the state and internationally."

This is a new program that resulted from the B-School for Beginners Class taught by Ronni Cohen.

The entrepreneurship program will not only apply basic skills, but will also have hands-on opportunities to master the Delaware economic standards as students learn to create their own ventures. Students learn creative problem-solving and decision-making techniques as they learn to look for opportunities. Students complete business plans and apply for loans to launch their ventures. Students learn to figure profit/loss and analyze the costs and benefits of their decision making.

Workshops are provided for other teachers in the team so that the program becomes part of the fourth-grade curriculum. They plan to open a school bank as part of the state treasurer's ""Bank at School"" program.

Designed as a model for urban renewal in the Nation's capital, the CfE represents a unique entrepreneurial approach to community economic development, self-sufficiency and personal growth for youth and adults, specifically low-income women and minority populations. This initiative utilizes a two-pronged approach to learning: (1) it equips youths and adults with the skills necessary to sustain themselves economically and (2) it uses a case study, experienced-based curriculum to imbed the concepts of entrepreneurship in the hearts and minds of youth and adult learners.

SEU's Center for Entrepreneurship was piloted in FY04 and publicly launched in October 2004. CfE has developed a program that includes a multifaceted approach to learning, including free seminars, fee-based seminars, clinics, short courses, as well as a certificate and college degree program. Each level of service deeply explores the subject matter and targeted areas of focus. In its short existence, the CfE has serviced 750+ clients, students and community members. For youth SEU are college partners for two programs, GEAR UP, a college preparatory program for high school students, and the Foundation for Excellent Schools, a college awareness program for elementary school students. Here, SEU uses entrepreneurship and small business issues to teach math and English literacy and comprehension. In 2005 SEU's held its first summer GEAR UP program, students learned financial literacy through Junior Achievement curriculum. In the summer of 2006, the SEU's GEAR UP program will expand to include the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship's curriculum.

SEU's signature program, the Certificate in Entrepreneurship, is a deliverables- based program. Students learn the fundamentals of marketing, sales & advertising, management, HR management, financial management, accounting, business and IT planning that will help them develop their small businesses and nonprofits. Students are required, in each course, to complete a component of a business plan that is needed for their small business, with the end results being a comprehensive business plan."

YUE (NFTE) is an in school program that teaches middle school students the essential tools of starting and operating their own businesses. With the support from NFTE, the students get to experience all the ideals and opportunities that it takes to start their own business from conception into actual implementation.

The program incorporates a hands-on method of teaching the students about business operation. Guest speakers, who are business owners from the District of Columbia, come in and talk to the students about the benefits of business ownership. Each student is directed to develop a business idea into an actual business plan that is presented in competition style and judged and awarded a prize. Students are also encouraged with the opportunity to take their ideas and products to events within the city and learn about networking and marketing. In the end, students walk away with the conceptual knowledge that they can run their own business and are presented with a different perspective of going to college for a new purpose.

Students are taught through experiential learning, which has been proven through studies to provide better outcomes of learning than standard classroom teaching. Students are also supported in their ideas by providing money and a trip to New York's wholesale district for them to purchase items and sell to make a profit. The program also offers incentives through healthy competition and constant presentation.

Institute of Business and Entrepreneurship",none listed,"Focus: Provide entrepreneurship education through an interdisciplinary business, social studies, and language arts curriculum.

Geographic Area: The IBE program is currently offered in three high schools in Broward County with an enrollment of approximately 100 students.

Products and Services: Products available include a comprehensive curriculum guide that includes activities, projects, and assessments designed for each individual course. Services provided to schools include identification of staff development opportunities and applicable instructional materials in addition to coordination of teacher training, student seminars, mentor/student orientations; mentor recruitment, and guest speaker recruitment.

Age Level: High school juniors and seniors.

Key Partners: Mentors/guest speakers from local businesses

Abstract: In 1995, the Institute of Business and Entrepreneurship (IBE) was developed as a collaborative effort between the school board of Broward County, Florida, and the Enterprise Ambassador USA of Nova Southeastern University. The IBE program is a two-year sequence of six courses designed to educate high school juniors and seniors about entrepreneurship and the opportunities and responsibilities of America's free enterprise system. The school board of Broward County, Florida, has been an associate member of the Consortium for Entrepreneurship Education since 1996.

The IBE program was originally designed to infuse Enterprise Ambassador USA activities and projects into an existing business management curriculum. The business management curriculum was expanded to include not only business-student standards (e.g., keyboarding, computer applications, business management, business law, and entrepreneurship) but also social-studies student standards (e.g., American government and economics). In 1998-99, the program was further expanded to include language arts student standards.

The IBE program is an exemplary school-to-work program that links the classroom to the real world of business through a project-oriented curriculum. IBE activities and projects include:

Business Mentors and Applied Business Studies-Students interact with their own personal business mentor through an applied business studies program.
Seminars-Students have an opportunity to meet successful entrepreneurs in a small group setting by attending the Broward County Career and Technical Student Conference. In addition, DeVry University sponsored an Entrepreneurship Workshop for the IBE students.
Special Projects-Juniors plan and implement a neighborhood-based community service project. Proceeds from the project are donated to local charities selected by the students.
By serving as mentors to elementary schools in their school's innovation zone, seniors teach elementary school students about free enterprise and the importance of goal setting and personal management. Seniors may also participate in a project that develops a supportive relationship with disadvantaged children in their own neighborhood.

Individual and School-Based Businesses-During the junior year, students develop a basic business plan. The senior curriculum focuses on the development of a comprehensive business plan. IBE students have an opportunity to put their business plans into action by planning and starting their own individual business or by participating in a school-based business. Examples of school-based businesses the students have planned, organized, and operated include a caf� for community school students, school stores, and a breakfast-delivery service for teachers.

Postsecondary Articulation and Scholarship Opportunities-Students who graduate from the IBE program may receive articulated college credit at Broward Community College. Students receive from three to six credits, depending on their postsecondary major. IBE students who meet all eligibility criteria qualify for the Florida Gold Seal Vocational Scholars Award and may qualify for other scholarships as well.

Special Recognition-Students earn community service hours by participating in special projects; receive recognition through participation in Business Professionals of America competitive events. Seniors are also recognized with the presentation of a special certificate of completion and a medallion."
FL,"Buchholz High School, 
Academy of Entrepreneurship",www.spiritspotbhs.com,"Focus: Senior high school

Abstract: The Academy of Entrepreneurship is an innovative four-year program at Buchholz High School in Gainesville, Florida. The Academy has been nationally recognized as a model for entrepreneurship education at the high school level by the Consortium for Entrepreneurship Education. In recognition of their outstanding program, teachers Dianne Lauramoore and Donna Martin received the coveted Leavey Award for Excellence in Free Enterprise Education from the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania in 2004. They were also chosen by the Florida Department of Education in 2006 to help establish five new entrepreneurship programs throughout the State by mentoring teachers and providing materials, workshops, and advice. In 2008 Mrs. Martin was awarded the Governor's Award by the Florida Council on Economic Education for the outstanding performance of her students in the successful operation of their school store, The Spirit Spot.

The Academy started in 1993 by Founding Director Dianne Lauramoore as an outgrowth of the business management and law course. Seeking to encourage specialization among students who envisioned themselves as entrepreneurs, she worked with school administrators and local entrepreneurs to develop a program which provides practical, experiential learning opportunities in a fun and rewarding way. In 1995 the Academy was designated a magnet program, allowing students from throughout the district to enroll. Today the Academy serves approximately 230 students per year and provides a wide variety of opportunities and experiences.

The Academy consists of four year-long courses for students in grades 9-12: Principles of Entrepreneurship, Business Management & Law, Business Ownership, and Retail Essentials. Additional optional courses are Marketing Internships and Marketing Directed Study. Curriculum follows the National Content Standards developed by the Consortium for Entrepreneurship Education, and teachers rely heavily on project-based instruction. An integral part of the program is DECA, and Academy students have developed a reputation for excellence in their projects and presentations. The Retail Essentials students operate The Spirit Spot, which is a 1,200 sq. ft. school store; beginning in 2005 they have earned DECA's Gold-Level Certification each year for this school-based enterprise. Students are responsible for all aspects of operating this business, which provides the opportunity to apply their learning.

Enrichment is provided through partnerships and collaborative efforts with a variety of community organizations. Working with Junior Achievement volunteers, students interact with local business leaders through seminars and mentoring in the classroom using the ""Success Skills"" and ""JA Company"" programs and then have opportunities to apply their knowledge by teaching similar classes at local elementary and middle schools. Academy students compete in the University of Florida's J. Leonhardt Business Plan competition and consistently impress the judges with their successful presentations demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of how to start a new business venture.

Under a tech-prep agreement with Santa Fe College and the School Board of Alachua County, students have the opportunity to earn up to twelve college credits by maintaining the required grade-point average and successfully completing the college exam. Additionally, upon completion of the third Academy course, students can qualify for the Gold Seal Scholarship which provides $2,000 per year at any postsecondary institution in Florida and which is renewable for four years.

This model program demonstrates how collaboration between educational institutions, community leaders, and business mentors can offer enterprising students the opportunity to capitalize on their passion and design their own futures while making learning fun and rewarding. Academy graduates leave with a much better knowledge of how to use their interests and natural abilities to develop their own business or to become managers in someone else's business. The teamwork, leadership, organization, and communication skills they acquire help them to become successful in a wide variety of entrepreneurial career choices. Through rigorous and relevant curriculum, dynamic projects, and hands-on learning experiences, students truly experience entrepreneurship in action.

High school students practice entrepreneurship as they operate their school store, grossing $45,000 last year from sales of tshirts, hoodies, books, and healthy snacks. Students are responsible for all aspects of The Spirit Spot including product design, purchasing, inventory, marketing, sales, customer service, and financial management. They rotate through the various jobs in the store and work in teams to develop new products or marketing strategies. For the last four years, The Spirit Spot has won DECA's national gold-level certification for school-based enterprises."

Abstract: The Institute for Youth Entrepreneurship (IYE), an innovative business skills development program, targets high school students who reside in Liberty City and its surrounding communities. The program aims to build community capacity by providing business skills training to inner city youth who have had little or no exposure to entrepreneurship education. The IYE places a premium on the comprehensive personal, social, cultural and moral development of youth. While building the requisite personal efficacy, self-confidence, and the knowledge and skills to be successful entrepreneurs, youth will gain critical exposures and orientation to important issues in the world of business.

The primary goal of the IYE is to expose and empower participating youth with the life skills needed for entrepreneurship and leadership. It is anticipated that a sizable percentage of the participants of this program will continue with some form of business activity, individual businesses or team business efforts after they complete the program. The program will also encourage youth to continue their education to support a business career. In addition, all graduates can be expected to benefit in other important and quantifiable ways, including expanded knowledge, improved attitude, business skills and leadership capacity. More importantly, they gain valuable work readiness skills that lead up to becoming an effective corporate leader or entrepreneur.

The program consists of three components:

Phase I
Academy of Future Entrepreneurs
NFTE - Entrepreneurship Training
Phase II
Spring Break Business Plan Camp
Phase III
Summer Entrepreneurship Experience

FL,"Northeast High School, Oakland Park—IBE Program Start-up",none listed,"Focus: High school, school-wide program

Abstract: Our program for IBE start-up is composed of three pieces: ""Planning and More Planning,"" ""Promotion and Publicity,"" and ""Pitfalls."" A brief description of each follows. The first and most important component is planning. Plan to invest a tremendous amount of time beforehand! We outlined and defined our program goals very early. Our initial concern was to personalize IBE for our school and our vision. As a result, we expanded the IBE courses to include an American history IBE course for program juniors. Next, we identified sophomores who might be likely IBE candidates and added a Pre-IBE designation to two business computer classes and a world history class for these students.

The second element for our start-up is ""Promote and Publicize."" Experience taught us the value of being highly visible. We developed our high profile not only within our school setting, but also in the community. Our Pre-IBE and IBE classes are hosting an annual career fair involving more than 50 local businesses with our partner in education, the Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce.

""Pitfalls: Look out for these . . ."" is the final piece. Deadlines happen! We created a series of prominent classroom displays including calendars, lists, and—most effective of all—a chart for tracking student performance. It's amazing what our students will do to earn their horseshoes and avoid bumblebees!

The Advanced Aftercare program is administered by the University of West Florida, College of Education, and Office of Juvenile Studies, and funded by the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice.

This project targets juvenile offenders who are returning to high-risk gang environments. Services are specifically tailored to overcome employment barriers in economically disadvantaged communities. Youths will receive two phases of skill development transferable to a wide range of occupations in the building trades, including services maintenance and related manufacturing.

The first phase of Building Success will provide youthful offenders with a full range of school-to-career planning, employability training, entrepreneurship education training, and pre-apprenticeship job coach assistance. Delivery of these services is provided by the project coordinator with the assistance of part-time job developers/coaches who are advanced university students engaged in integrating their duties with academic studies. Both in-school and out-of-school youthful offenders receive a form of pre-apprenticeship training conducted in the vocational shop located on the University of West Florida campus.

A total of 45 youths per year receive first-phase services. This is structured into three time periods, each four months in duration. Youths will be recruited in teams of 15 per time period. The majority of team activities will take place at the vocational shop located on the University of West Florida campus. A vocational aftercare teacher/counselor will instruct youths in the safe operation of equipment and guide teams in various entrepreneurship construction activities. The shop is open three days per week, from 3 p.m. until 8 p.m.

Job developers/coaches assist youths with transportation needs and guide youths on various entrepreneurship education projects, as well as mentor them on non-shop days. Youths are guided in the planning, design, final assembly, and distribution of products. Profits from the sale of these products are shared in an equitable manner among the team members. Where appropriate, funds will be earmarked to comply with court-ordered restitution. Additional first-phase services include enhanced access to long-term education and training opportunities facilitated through the local school-to-work initiatives in Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties.

Second-phase services are individualized and target job placement and job coach assistance in two forms, in-school and out-of-school."

Abstract: The Junior Achievement Satellite office began in the spring of 1998 in Hall County and Gainesville Schools. Initially they had 56 classes and have 170 classes requested this year. Junior Achievement began as an after school program but in the past 25 years has shifted to a curriculum-based program with age appropriate, hands-on programs K - 12 grades and an international program.

The Junior Achievement program wil instill in students a clearer understanding of the relevance of education to the achievement of their long term personal well being, and will provide schools an integrated systematic approach to economic education. The curriculum is tailored to the learning skills of students K-12 through the use of Junior Achievement's traditional ""hands-on"" delivery approach. Trained volunteers will teach the classes to students in cooperation with their teacher. The volunteer provides real-life experiences, helps bring a different perspective for students, and shows the community is interested in them as individuals.

Junior Achievement can serve as a change agent to give students the tools they need to be workforce ready, and inspire them to make choices that will allow them to improve their own lives. JA programs take a pro-active position in providing students with the practical knowledge critical to making the transition from school to work, and ultimately to being productive members of the workforce."

Abstract: The Stephens Technology Entrepreneurship Program (STEP) will provide the instruction and experience necessary for students to develop and sustain a business. The school will offer one Entrepreneur class each semester. This class would use established entrepreneur curriculum and training methods. Students from business education classes (accounting, business applications, etc.) and from the technology education program would be recruited to participate, as well as other students interested in entrepreneurship.

Entrepreneurship students would develop a business, based on the concepts taught through this curriculum, that would entail assembling and selling computers. Students would be taught all aspects of entrepreneurship, and would develop and run the business. Based on a successful implementation of this concept, the school system will agree to purchase at least 50 student-built computers annually. These funds would return to the program to purchase computer parts for the next year. This would add sustainability to the other benefits of the program.

Through the experience of developing and running a business, students would learn how to do a market survey, develop a five-year business plan, compute profit and loss, and many other valuable skills. Those students with A+ computer repair training would also benefit from having more hands-on experience in building computers.

Students will also be encouraged to stay in school through the utilization of a mentoring and volunteer program. The mentoring coordinator will recruit, train, and schedule volunteers to work with the STEP classes and the school at large. Special emphasis will be placed on using business representatives to mentor entrepreneurship students, however, many other at-risk students will also benefit from the mentoring program."

This includes a ""gallery"" of exhibition rooms featuring fundamental concepts, macro-, micro-, and international economics. Users can take as much or as little time as necessary to explore and learn at exactly the depth desired. Many of the materials on the CD may be printed for educational purposes.

""Virtual Economics"" will run on any computer with at least a double-speed CD-ROM drive, Windows 3.1 or Macintosh II (System 7.0 or later) system with at least 8MB of memory, a 13"" color monitor, a sound card, and speakers. It is designed with vivid full-color graphics, three-dimensional settings, newsreel footage, films, and photographs. It also includes voices of those who have made economic history, as well as those who have been affected by it.

The possibilities for using this resource among the participants are multiple. Ultimately, the user determines what they need and in how much detail. The program allows mix and match to create individualized lessons. Implications for consideration include classroom teaching, teacher education (preservice), teacher training (preservice), research, and individualized training, tutorial, and instruction.

Abstract: Diamonds in the Ruff is a nonprofit organization geared toward the interest of children and youth. The Bronzeville Business Academy is a program that is community based under the auspices of Diamonds in the Ruff. It is designed for business development in a community undergoing major revitalization. It is focused around developing and highlighting the history of Bronzeville through youth enterprises.

Our program was created to promote self-sufficiency through active participation in a community that houses the highest concentration of public housing in the nation, and high drop-out and unemployment rates. Our youth remain community and culturally connected but with a global focus. They share in the responsibility of self and community pride. Bronzeville was once a self-contained community prior to integration. and to be an entrepreneur was the norm in this community. Many African-Americans migrated from the South, and entrepreneurship ran through generations of families.

Bronzeville is also known for its many historical sites and beautiful architecture. Tourism has been an industry working its way into the Bronzeville community. Additionally, the nation's largest (the world second largest) convention center sits at the entrance of the Bronzeville community. Our youths have observed the problems in their community and are striving to turn them into positive opportunities. We have developed a working mentor/protégé relationship with an 18-year-old local travel business located in Bronzeville. Our youths are developing historical tours of Bronzeville showcasing the homes of the late Louis Armstrong, Ida B. Wells, Joe Louis, Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, and many others. These tours are marketed to the conventioneers who are visiting Chicago and patronizing the Convention Center. Many other Chicagoans are fascinated by the history of Bronzeville and the architecture. Therefore, there is a constant influx of interested groups.

The program works in collaboration with the local schools. Each young participant qualifies to earn (mandatory) school community-service points. The businesses are developed and run by our young entrepreneurs. Those who decide not to become entrepreneurs are still beneficiaries of business training.

This program is to assist in the re-development of the Bronzeville community with new and young ideas, giving youths the opportunity to be active participants in the development of community in which they live. Components covered in the training are: self-esteem/self-awareness and assessments; conflict resolution, customer service, peer support and mentoring, community pride for global opportunities, business etiquette, production-vs.-consumption, wealth building, negotiations, budgeting, marketing, management planning, and technical assistance.

Students of BBA get to experience the fun and fast-paced environment of running a real business. Youths direct every step of the business process, from planning and designing products to marketing finished goods.

BBA gives youths the opportunity to learn practical business skills in areas such as strategic planning, economics, computers, and management. Also, our students get the opportunity to take field trips to visit businesses around the city and meet business owners to learn more about how they are operated. Our goal is to be community based with a global perspective."

Abstract: Running an in-school business is the most effective way to teach, motivate, and empower students to become successful entrepreneurs now and in the future. At the conception, students recognized a need of many students at the school, and, in turn, jumped at the opportunity to fulfill the need by becoming business owners. As a school that serves a large population of low socio-economic students, many seniors are unable to purchase senior portrait packages at the local photography studio, leaving the student and their families without the lasting memory of completing high school. Sadly, these students' pictures do not appear in the school's yearbook as well. The entrepreneurship students of Hillcrest High School saw the need of their classmates and developed a plan to serve their classmates.

With the elevator grant winnings, I was able to secure the basic equipment for a portable in-school photography studio. A professional-grade camera, lighting system, and backgrounds were purchased under student recommendation and the business began. After researching competitors and surveying students, students developed affordable portrait packages, marketed the business, and began taking client photographs during back-to-school registration in August. Profits have been earmarked to expand the business to reach a greater target market of the student body, including informal photographs, group shots, and event coverage. Students truly are gaining a wealth of experience that will continue to serve them well into adulthood.

The students have built or upgraded more than 150 computers for the school, set up a shop selling refurbished computers, and developed the Free Community Computer Program for three community after-school programs. This free community program provides free computers, technical support, and student teachers who teach computer introduction and typing. Something special happens when students become teachers.

The Cyber Service is now expanding into a Council of School Based Enterprises, a business incubator. New businesses starting up, using the computer lab and Cyber Service as a base, include firms offering accounting and business services, and The Green Team, a horticulture/landscaping unit.

David N. Finkel is an independent consultant and director of the Morton East Cyber Service. The Cyber Service milestones include two statewide awards and a full-page article in the Cicero Life newspaper.

This program was initially funded by three different grants. The Urban-Rural Opportunities Grant was the first and primary source, with additional help from Education to Careers and Job Training Partnership Act. Most current government grants have sunset dates; that is, at the end of five years (a common grant length) a program must find a way to pay for itself. The good ones survive. A very entrepreneurial problem— when seed money runs out, an entrepreneur must find a way to keep going. The students are organizing into a presentation team to begin building contributions (tax deductable) from the community. The goal, a necessity, is to become self-sufficient in two years.

Abstract: WLIS Academy students are highly motivated, highly capable students in U-46 who gain admittance to this four-year program through a rigorous screening process. Students represent the ethnically and economically diverse communities of our extensive K–12 district (second largest in Illinois).

This is a four-year, articulated, integrated program featuring foreign language, international social studies and history, language arts, and business.

Students enter into the program and develop basic computer skills to enhance all studies in the academy during the first two years of the program. Career education is also integrated into the first two years, as well as exposure to business topics through exploring the Internet and guest speakers and programs.

The purpose of the Global Business Topics class offered during the third year is to further develop students' ability to function successfully in a global economy. It introduces students to the fundamental principles, foundations, and practices of entrepreneurship; international business and economics; time and money management; career development; communication and team skill development; and the more effective use of technology to acquire, process, and exchange information. It includes an establishment of a community mentor for each student. The fourth year is an internship program individualized for the needs of the students.

The model for this entire program is visionary: recognition of the knowledge and skills necessary for participation in a global economy. While foreign language academies exist nationwide, few integrate business concepts as this one does.

In addition to interfacing with foreign language, social studies, and language arts classes, students participate in activities that clearly show the connection among the disciplines. Among these are the Virtual Trade Mission sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce and Distributive Education Clubs of America (DECA), an association of marketing students. All students will prepare for the Entrepreneurship Written Event and the Participating Event, and all levels have an opportunity to compete. About a third of our students participated in DECA last year, with one student winning first place at the state competition and others competing successfully.

The results of the week-long Virtual Trade Mission held here, culminating in a reception and open house forum at Northwestern University, included enthusiastic parent and community support, student interest, and student confidence."

Abstract: The Going Solo program is adaptable to a wide variety of audiences because it is an activity-based program with a broad range of activities for each topic in entrepreneurship education. Special success has been achieved at the senior high school level, community college level, and in alternative schools. Going Solo has been adopted in more than 15 countries and has been successfully incorporated in community-based organizational programs. In special circumstances, the Going Solo program fits well within junior high schools.

The Going Solo curriculum is designed to be used by educators in a variety of settings who want to incorporate entrepreneurship training and experiences into their existing curricula or develop new curricula. The program has been evolving for more than six years and is currently in use in over 15 countries. It has been particularly welcomed by high schools and alternative or ""safe"" schools, although it has been adopted in a wide variety of middle school, high school, and community college settings. Instructors are given activities to guide students through understanding the concepts of effective entrepreneurship. A computer-based market simulation game reinforces concepts, as well as effectively focusing on creativity, group, communication, and math skills.

The development of an entrepreneurship curriculum can be challenging, especially if it is incorporated as part of a larger, umbrella curriculum, such as consumer economics. The Going Solo program has also been mapped into the Illinois State Learning Standards for ease of curriculum design. The activities and market simulation are designed to be very flexible for use in a variety of settings. Various skill sets, time constraints, and the incorporation of additional materials can be accommodated. Going Solo has been used for a three-day camp and for a 16-week semester course. Each instructor can choose the activities that fit his or her needs.

Many entrepreneurship educators do not have a background or education in business. Therefore, each Going Solo module contains a set of objectives, a ""One Minute Lesson"" for the instructor, and a set of coordinated yet independent activities. Masters for photocopying are also included.

Educators may adapt the various components of Going Solo into a coherent curriculum based on their students' skill levels, the situational constraints of time and requirements, and how to use the simulation game to reinforce concepts of the curriculum."

Any student may take Entrepreneurship courses. There are no prerequisites for these classes. Westfield High School has a diverse cultural and socioeconomic population. All students are encouraged and welcome to enroll in Entrepreneurship.

Westfield offers Entrepreneurship I, II, and III. Students can also enroll in our Entrepreneurship Academy which requires all of the entrepreneurship courses along with a course titled Entrepreneurship Professional Internship. This curriculum is based upon the National Standards for Marketing, Management, Entrepreneurship, and Business Administration.

Entrepreneurship I covers subjects such as identifying business opportunities, communication and math skills, economics, types of ownership, market research, and developing a business plan. This course uses the textbook ""Entrepreneurship Ideas in Action"" by Cynthia L. Greene.
Entrepreneurship II students create a complete business plan for a business which is feasible for a high school student. The first two weeks are spent brainstorming business ideas, names, and logos. The rest of the trimester is used to study each section of the business plan and research realistic prices. The students then incorporate this information into their actual plan. These students are required to have a mentor in the business world. We use the NXLevel curriculum developed by The US West Foundation, University of Colorado at Denver.
Entrepreneurship III students run the school's bookstore, The Shamrock Shop, along with other ""Apprentice"" type competitions. Students are responsible for keeping inventory, cash records, and marketing.
All of these courses include hands on activities, guest speakers, and field trips. The Hamilton County Alliance (HCA) is an organization devoted to promoting economic development in Hamilton County Indiana. They also sponsor an event called ""Spotlight on Entrepreneurship"" where students attend a one day conference about entrepreneurs. This years spotlight featured the ""Extreme Entrepreneurship Tour."" The HCA also provides guest speakers from the community and locations for field trips.

Abstract: The program is geared for all 9th graders at Decorah High School. Other business/marketing students do utilize certain enhanced parts of the program.

The class is called Essential Skills I, all of the 9th grade students will explore seven units of instruction aligned with the federal SCANS Report, the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills. The units covered will include economics, law, global understanding, personal finance, entrepreneurship, and marketing. Each unit introduces key concepts in context-based, hands-on problem-solving activities using Microsoft Office 2000 computer applications. The entire learning experience of Essential Skills I will be interactive with student progress maintained through an electronic journal.

The Entrepreneurship Unit provides students with the opportunity to learn about entrepreneurship and small businesses. Students study the traits of an entrepreneur and the steps necessary to start a business. They learn the secrets of how and why a business succeeds or fails and then have the opportunity to start their own business. Hands-on activities include using Microsoft Word to prepare a partnership contract, design a company logo and write a business plan. Students design a T-shirt concept with Microsoft Word and use Microsoft Excel to work through an analysis of cost of goods, profit and pricing.

Finally, students develop a PowerPoint presentation of their business plan and then actually produce a finished product using a heat-transfer press. Conference participants will be taken through a few examples of the actual program. Laptops or computers will be used."
IA,Luther College,www.luther.edu,"Focus: Experiential learning on college campuses

Geographic Area: Iowa

Abstract: While in the middle of a snowstorm, have you ever imagined teaching a class or workshop on the warm, sun-bleached beach of a tropical island? Would having nice cold refreshments served from a refrigerator located close-by appeal to you? Well, teaching entrepreneurship can involve both of these ""daydreams"" and get students excited about the possibilities of becoming an entrepreneur. This presentation will focus on how to involve students in this daydream, how to help them learn things usually not found in the traditional classroom, and how to have fun doing it.

Experiential learning may be the missing link in many entrepreneurship courses taught on college campuses today. The many skills necessary to start and run a business can be taught using textbooks, case studies, and exercises in class, and can be enhanced with good class discussions and maybe even examinations. But the spirit and excitement often expressed by entrepreneurs is something that must be ""felt."" Experiential learning allows students to apply theories by seeing and visiting entrepreneurs in their own settings and/or giving them the opportunity to become and entrepreneur and learn by doing. The following examples illustrate how the program has incorporated experiential learning both inside and outside the classroom.

Tourism is the world's largest industry and is becoming a welcome and lucrative option for isolated economies when there are natural resources to attract visitors. For the last twelve years, we have been examining the economic development of these isolated areas and have been intrigued by the similarities, challenges, and opportunities that face these communities. While teaching an intensive three-week course during January, we involved students in a collaborative research project that focused on the development of island economies. We used the Islands of the Bahamas and the Canary Islands as the classroom. By using isolated areas which function like island nations for the focus of our study, we could see within a relatively compact geographical area how all the pieces of the economic puzzle fit together. Students were immersed in the new culture, conducted environmental scans, and identified and interviewed key individuals who were instrumental in changing the community and providing leadership for an economy supported by tourism. Entrepreneurs and small family businesses thrive in these communities, and by seeing and meeting these individuals in their own setting we could bring the entrepreneurial spirit to life.

Outside the classroom but back on campus, an entrepreneurship club was created and was exploring ways to raise money to support activities, research, and trips to CEO conferences and regional SIFE competitions. While researching the market, a local businessman approached the club with the opportunity to buy his business - renting refrigerators on the college campus! The motivation was money, but the experience has helped students develop the skills needed to become entrepreneurs. The students struggled with strategic planning and develop the day-to-day operational programs needed to run a successful business. Courses in marketing finance, accounting and human resource management may have provided them with the theory, but operating this business has helped them feel the spirit and the enthusiasm (and the work) needed to establish and operate their own business.

Inventory is ""sold out"" again for the seventh consecutive year, and current members are faced with making decisions regarding the purchase and upkeep of more refrigerators in order to support the club in subsequent years. Planning how to transfer the business from one generation of students to the next is another major concern challenging these entrepreneurs.

In summary, experiential learning can provide students opportunities not usually afforded in a traditional classroom. Both projects have been highly participatory and interdisciplinary in nature. The study abroad course has also provided students with a multi-cultural experience, and a break from the January snowstorms of eastern Iowa. Learning can take place in many environments - even near the sun, the sand, and the sea - or through a frig!"

Abstract: The Center for Tribal Entrepreneurial Studies (CTES) was established in 1996 to bring the entrepreneurial spirit to American Indian and Alaska Native individuals and communities. The emphasis is on a holistic, Native-American-values-based program that encourages self-sufficiency. In addition to the long-term educational component of a degree program at the higher education level, CTES provides training to elected tribal leaders in developing entrepreneurship-friendly communities, and has established a youth component with the current Haskell Elementary Teacher Education program.

CTES is a new component of the business program at Haskell Indian Nations University in Lawrence, Kansas. In 1996, the Kauffman Foundation provided the center a three-year grant to achieve three goals:

Develop an associate of arts degree in culturally relevant entrepreneurship
Incorporate entrepreneurial components with the university teacher-education program serving grades one to eight
Provide training in entrepreneurship and teaching entrepreneurship for tribal leaders and members.
A unique training program offered is the Community Innovation and Renewal through Creative Learning and Entrepreneurship case study development held in conjunction with Babson College. The program is focused on developing a cadre faculty from across the nation that have the skills and networks to develop curriculum and case studies on successful Native American entrepreneurs. The case studies incorporate the Native American storytelling way of learning through development of a video."

Products and Services: High school students' focus is on the integration of academic and applied entrepreneurial studies and skills

Age Level: Students in grades 11 and 12

Key Partners: Teachers, administrators, and business community who collaborate to benefit the school.

Abstract: The goal of REDI is to create a school that provides learners with exceptional opportunities in entrepreneurial studies that result in the knowledge, behaviors, and skills essential for success in the changing twenty-first-century world of work

REDI is located within an incubator for small business called the Quest Center. There are currently over 25 businesses housed at the Quest Center. An advisory board, consisting of county superintendents and business and community partners, has been established. The advisory board provides leadership, guidance, and accountability.

Students are not constrained by the traditional ""40-minute period,"" but rather have an extended block of time that is conducive to meaningful, engaged learning. Students choose between a morning and afternoon class that run for three hours each.

Juniors and seniors from all county high schools are eligible to make application to REDI. Up to 30 students per year are selected. Student selection criteria include school attendance, self-motivation, perseverance, goals, etc.

Students explore the concepts of entrepreneurship and ""intrepreneurship"" not only with the instructor and fellow students, but also in the ""real world of work"". Special attention is given to providing student encounters with entrepreneurial opportunities and careers not readily apparent to them. They will understand that the art of being a successful entrepreneur has a lot to do with having certain intangible personal characteristics, such as leadership skills, people skills, planning skills, and management skills. Students use software such as Office 2000, QuickBooks 2000, and FrontPage 2000 to complete the REDI curriculum. Students create business plans and present their ideas to advisory board members, administrators, and business leaders. Two classroom business simulations are run through REDI. REDI Print is a direct print/computers graphics business that also generates the REDI Newsletter. Squawkwa is a bottled water wholesale distribution company. Both companies are student run and organized. Students are encouraged to start their own businesses as well."
KS,"Olathe East High School,

Age Level: High school grades 10-12

Abstract: During the school year over 80 students will be a part of the management class. The students' abilities range from the gifted class to those with special needs. The Hawks Nest will be open to a student body of 1,300 students in grades 1–12.

Students in the management classes will have the opportunity to operate a retail store within the walls of Olathe East High School. For example, they will be responsible for product selection, inventory, pricing, advertising, and publicity.

The management classes are also working with other classes in the school to involve students from numerous academic areas. One example of this is the commercial art class that will design a new license plate that will be sold in the Hawks Nest.

Another example of cross-curricular education is the Olathe East greeting-card line. An English class will design the copy; an art class will create the covers. The cards will be printed in a computer class and will then be sold by the management class. A single card will have the collaboration of at least 4 or 5 students.

One key element of the Hawks Nest is giving the students the authority to make decisions and having them see the immediate results of their choices. Their decisions will have a much greater impact than just getting a right or wrong answer on a test.

Another unique feature is the number of students that can be involved without actually having to be in the class. (i.e. English1, Art, Computer, Fashion)."

Wide diversity of students - many international students interested in learning American business models as well as non-traditional students coming back to school to learn about entrepreneurship and have the opportunity for experiential learning with a seasoned entrepreneur as a mentor.

Abstract: The Kauffman Entrepreneurial Internship Program Course (KEIP) program at UMKC is a multi-dimensional program involving a 3 credit hour course and a 300-hour work assignment with the CEO of a local entrepreneurial business. The program is designed to give students opportunity for experiential learning and to observe first hand what's involved in owning a business on a daily basis, while offering project assistance to small businesses at an affordable rate. Students become University employees ""loaned"" to the host businesses, thus freeing the business of employment paperwork and taxes. Midway through the semester host businesses remit approximately 2/3 of the students' stipend to the University, with the remainder covered by grants and endowment funds.

Student work assignments in the host businesses are project focused - marketing promotions, research, financial analysis, financial planning, web site development, etc. The only requirement is that the student is included in strategic planning, team meetings, customer meetings and other events, which will provide insight into the daily operations of the business.

The course deals with basic concepts of for-profit entrepreneurship, as well as social entrepreneurship, with special focus on local entrepreneurs. Periodically through the semester the group travels to visit an entrepreneur. Other times the entrepreneur's come into the classroom to share their experiences. A portion of each class is a free forum where students relate their learning experiences from their work.

First class assignment is for students and their hosts to sit down together and develop a ""Terms of Engagement Letter"" describing the projects that the intern will work on; a confidentiality agreement; and a project timeline that will be used to measure job performance. At the conclusion of the course students and hosts come together for a dinner and presentation by the students describing their learning experiences and the future plans."
KS,Youth Entrepreneurs of Kansas,www.yeks.org,"Focus: High School

Abstract: Entrepreneurship is more than just owning a business. It is an approach to life, a way of thinking, an option for the future. This mindset of self-reliance and accountability is the underlying premise of Youth Entrepreneurs of Kansas, Inc. With more than 600 students enrolled annually, this non-profit is beginning its second decade of helping young people learn business skills that can help them be self-sufficient, productive citizens.

Youth Entrepreneurs of Kansas (YEK) focuses on three goals:

to provide the knowledge for students to start and maintain their own business;
to help students understand how to apply that knowledge and be a better employee for others (to act like an owner); and
to encourage students to pursue higher education.
Students enroll in YEK as a business or life skills elective, and receive credit for the course, just as they would math or English. As a part of the class, students write and present business plans. A panel of local business and community leaders judge the plans based on such criteria as viability, competitive advantage and goal-setting rationale.

YEK is a licensee of NFTE, The National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship. The program uses NFTE's curriculum, which strongly emphasizes experiential learning to teach students essential business skills. Access to business professionals also has proven to be an essential component for success in the classroom. YEK instructors frequently invite speakers to share their successes, failures and advice with students. YEK's comprehensive program extends beyond the classroom, giving students the opportunity to compete for venture capital grants, earn college scholarships, participate in summer business partnerships and become YEK Ambassadors (a program for YEK graduates that emphasizes leadership and community service).

While the classroom education is the core of YEK, staff members are able to continue to encourage entrepreneurial attitudes through these additional programs. One such opportunity is with the summer business partnerships. Each summer, several area businesses, such as Salomon Smith Barney and Cessna Aircraft Company, host 12-15 students. The students spend several weeks learning about all aspects of the company.

During the Salomon Smith Barney program, for example, each student is paired with a financial consultant. The students meet individually with their consultant, as well as with the rest of the group, to learn about various aspects of the financial services industry. At the end of the summer, students present what they have learned about the industry, and information on a specific stock they tracked throughout the summer. The top two students win an all-expense paid trip to New York City, where they tour Wall Street, the Salomon Smith Barney international headquarters, and many other popular New York venues.

YEK is offered in 12 public high schools in the Wichita and Topeka areas. Enrollment is open to all students, but the program is specifically targeted at youths who are considered at-risk. Indeed, the program's premise is that students who have experienced adversity often possess street smarts that - through education - can be parlayed into entrepreneurial skills."
KY,Bellarmine University,www.bellarmine.edu,"Abstract: The focus of this program is to build interest in entrepreneurship in the students. The students should be inspired and motivated by the program, and will build their knowledge of entrepreneurship from those who have the experience.

How do you excite entrepreneurship in students? I believe the best way to do this is to let them hear from others who have been successful and from some who were not initially but did not give up. While it may not be feasible or even possible to get Bill Gates, Michael Dell, Jim Bezo, etc. to come to your class I do not believe this is necessary. Following 20 + years as an entrepreneur who has had both successes and failures and doesn't mind talking about either, I discovered an excitement in my classroom that I have not discovered in the multitude of cases and textbook readings we have covered. As an adjunct professor during eight of my entrepreneurial years I was reluctant to share many of my ""war"" stories for fear of class turning into my life story. However, as I have joined the full time faculty ranks I have discovered that when properly selected and focused, my experiences have brought concepts, theories and the occasional sleepy student to life. I noticed that the students' level of engagement was increased significantly during these discussions; yes discussions, not just telling ""war stories"". I involved the students and had learning objectives with each discussion.

This brings me to the idea that I have tested albeit on a limited basis. After evaluating the higher level engagement of the student (both undergraduates and graduates) I decided that one of the reasons they were more engaged is that the case comes to life with my involvement and inside information. This led me start the development of a series of taped interviews of experienced entrepreneurs from the region. These entrepreneurs would be recognizable to the students due to the product, service, the local media coverage or the like. Some of the students I have found even know these entrepreneurs and can often make the connection for the instructor. I have been able to tap into the contacts I made in my 20 + years as an active business and community representative.

My strategy is to develop a series of tapes which would be focused on various topics I would cover in a typical semester of classes. With a series of seven tapes I can utilize one approximately every other class to supplement the topic in the textbook and discussion. An added bonus is that by only using each taped interview once a semester, most entrepreneurs are willing to come to the class and provide a Q & A session. Where this practice has been tested, the students rave about the session and continue to reference the video discussion for weeks following the showing and entrepreneur's visit. Additionally, the students continue to apply what they learned to subsequent class topics.

Sample topics might be:

Startup (where did you get the business idea? What motivated you to go out on your own?)
Financing the business at startup and in the growth phase?
Challenges faced by entrepreneurs (Most exciting and most frustrating moments.
Recommendations for anyone embarking on a similar project:

Do your homework on the company and have students do the same; go into class prepared and well versed on the company and the entrepreneur.
Set time limit for the video showing (break it into segments) (one entrepreneur interview was 45 min long).
Plan your class schedule well in advance so you can get the entrepreneur to come to the appropriate class (prepare yourself for last minute cancellations-have a backup plan).

Abstract: According to the Appalachian Regional Commission, the best hope for stabilizing and diversifying Appalachia's economy lies in the creation and expansion of businesses that provide jobs, build local wealth and contribute broadly to economic and community development. The need to expand and support entrepreneurial activity as a means for revitalizing Appalachian communities led to the creation of Berea College's Entrepreneurship for the Public Good (EPG) program. This interdisciplinary program seeks to equip students of all majors to be agents of change and to connect them with entrepreneurs working to realize Appalachia's economic and social potential. Through the program, students learn how small businesses and nonprofit agencies employ socially responsible practices to provide jobs and build healthy communities.

The EPG program, launched in 2002, includes a two-year entrepreneurship and leadership program, expanded entrepreneurship curriculum offerings, and campus-wide entrepreneurship and leadership activities. At the heart of the EPG program is the EPG Summer Institute. Through case studies, reading, guest lectures, field trips, and team projects, participants explore entrepreneurship, leadership, and community development in the context of Appalachian communities. Students are taught by an interdisciplinary team of faculty and leaders in the field. Students are assigned a community-based project, which they must complete during the first summer. Trips to various businesses and organizations in the region offer opportunities to apply what students learn in the classroom. Students receive eight academic credits for the Summer Institute experience and are paid a stipend for their work ($2,800 per summer) which meets daily from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.

During the second summer, EPG Fellows participate in the James Bowling Entrepreneurial Internship Program, which offers opportunities for students to work with businesses or nonprofit enterprises. Interns will individually work with EPG and other faculty members to create portfolios that will help assess each student's learning with a focus on his/her integration of entrepreneurship, leadership and public good principles. The ultimate goal of the Entrepreneurship for the Public Good program is to engage Berea students in entrepreneurship and leadership activities, in order to enable them to:

Explore theoretical and practical approaches to entrepreneurship for the public good in the context of sustainable economic development in Appalachia and beyond;
Develop entrepreneurial and leadership skills;
Engage in academically rigorous and critically reflective, service-learning projects, designed in partnership with regional businesses and nonprofit organizations;
Prepare for meaningful work lives; and
Add value to small businesses and nonprofits in the region."

Abstract: Entrepreneurial apirit has been demonstrated throughout history but sometimes that ""spirit"" doesn't work itself into the mind of the high school student. As social studies instructors, we are constantly weaving a web of connections so that our students can see the whole picture. In both American and world studies, we try to weave in geography, government, culture, the arts, and economics as well as national standards. Economics and entrepreneurship are easily integrated into the social studies curriculum. The following integration ideas show the simplicity of incorporating economics into the existing curriculum.

1.  While studying the late 1800s, students created a postage stamp research project of an American entrepreneur. As a result of their research, students decided to complete the process necessary for introducing a series idea to the U.S. Postal Service. Students created the application and letters of support for a new series, Celebrating America's Entrepreneurial Spirit.
2.  Using the case studies and biographic sketches found in the Entrepreneurs in Kentucky (EconomicsAmerica) material, students participated in a field trip to the Texas Road House Restaurant for lunch, a tour, and a question-and-answer session with Louisville entrepreneur Kent Star, founder of Texas Road House.
3.  The final assessment will be for students to design and create their own business. American studies and world studies students will be given the opportunity to create, develop, and present their ideas for a new restaurant. Students are given a theme: American studies students have the 1920s, and world studies students, the Renaissance.
Students are to create and develop a plan for their restaurant to present to a board of investors. The plans must include specific ideas for what art will be displayed, the music that will be played, foods served, dress for wait staff, and even souvenirs or premiums that will be available. All information must be historically accurate. Students gain a better understanding of the time period being studied; they learn how to organize their ideas, and how to prepare for a public presentation."

Abstract: Designer Tickets and More is a school-based enterprise developed as a supplement to the Business Management course. When a free piece of ticket-making software arrived in the mail, the idea for the venture was born.

Estill County High School was host for a district basketball tournament when the business originated in 1998, making tickets for the tournament. Students learned to work with customers in the community to meet the needs for new products. Creative thinking and problem solving skills enabled the students to expand to meet the growing needs of the community. The services requested from local business, and demand from students to participate, became so great that another entrepreneurship class was developed, enabling the business to operate year-round.

The enterprise now makes note cards, brochures, flyers, menus, business cards, bumper stickers, mugs, message boards, and many other special orders. Today the enterprise is so successful that the business' equipment now includes three computers, a sublimation printer, a color laser printer, several inkjet printers, two scanners, a labeling machine, heat presses, T-shirt making equipment, and a vinyl sign maker.

As material is covered in the classroom, the information is directly applied by the students to the operation of the business. Students developed the name of the business, company policies, operating procedures, staff positions, and evaluation procedures. The current business has co-CEOs, an office manager, three production departments, a sales department, and a marketing department. Students receive employee evaluations weekly from student department heads, the student CEOs evaluate the department heads, and the teacher evaluates the CEOs.

Students also deal directly with the business community: the sales departments calls on potential customers, the marketing department works with the local newspaper to get publicity in the community, an office supply business works with students to source supplies at discount prices, and a printing company acts as a general business resource and mentor.

Currently this program is only at the high school. However, students from this class introduced entrepreneurship to the 5th grade of the local elementary school. Under the guidance of the high school students, the elementary classes had a competition to develop a business and operate it at a school fair. Each elementary class was provided with start-up venture money, and the class with the greatest profit went on a field trip to a related business. The idea of this school-based enterprise has also been shared at state vocational conferences."

When they graduated to high school, several SLIP students then joined another SEC program—Educational Designs that Generate Excellence (EDGE). Through EDGE, these teenagers are exploring ideas for beginning businesses. A group in Jackson County held a trade fair where the students were able to sell their products, which ranged from jewelry and handmade bags to compact discs and raffle tickets. EDGE and the other resources available through SEC offer students, teachers, and community members a way to help students prepare for graduation by learning lifelong skills and gaining insight about how they can be contributing members of their local community.

Abstract: The Owsley County High School's Family and Consumer Science Department students have ventured into the world of technology with their new computerized sewing machine. In this class the students are learning to utilize the equipment whereby they can start their own entrepreneurial enterprises.

The program purchased a highly sophisticated electronic sewing machine with embroidery capabilities. Students design digital graphics using a Customizer 1000 Easy Giga Hoop or paint software. Then the design is transferred from the computer to the Janome Memory Craft 1000 to create professional style embroidery. These designs appear on t-shirts, shirts, bags, totes, caps, etc. The students have developed a school-based enterprise called ""Owls' Stitchery"" for marketing their products. They have experienced first-hand how the world of work has changed with technology advancements."

Abstract: Entrepreneurs in Kentucky, an educational delivery system developed by EconomicsAmerica in Kentucky, emphasizes basic economic concepts and entrepreneurship using Kentucky history, entrepreneurs, and economic development as general themes throughout the lessons.

Each lesson provides background materials about one or more Kentucky entrepreneurs. The accompanying videotape provides supplemental opportunities for students to learn about the lives of Kentucky entrepreneurs. Each lesson identifies student learning objects, the Kentucky Learning Goals and Academic Expectations, and the EconomicsAmerica Voluntary National Content Standards. Lessons also have a ""Connect"" section that suggests how the lessons can be used to teach English, mathematics, science, music, and art, as well as social studies. The Connect section also provides ideas for involving the community to learn about entrepreneurship and economics in Kentucky.

The curriculum has been disseminated to teachers throughout the state through enrollment in a graduate distance-learning course and/or attendance at a three-hour professional development workshop. In addition to the written curriculum and supplemental videotape, the Entrepreneurs in Kentucky initiative has created partnerships between teachers and entrepreneurs.

The entrepreneurs have assumed a mentorship role to their partner teacher and students. Because the teacher and entrepreneur partner are encouraged to develop the activities that fit them best, descriptive information will be obtained about the development and maturation of the partnership. Preliminary information indicates that the partnerships have involved email communications, classroom visits, field trips, individual research projects, mock employment interviews, and sharing of personal histories.

Initial studies of the impact of the Entrepreneurs in Kentucky curriculum project have focused on the effects of the program on student knowledge of specific economic and entrepreneurial concepts as well as student attitudes toward entrepreneurship. The results of the analysis indicated that the program had significant effects in student understanding of the economic and entrepreneurial concepts of: entrepreneurial motivation, entrepreneurs' impact on industries, profits, factors of production, and the forces of supply and demand. The results also indicated that the students thought entrepreneurs are good for our state and community, and students indicated that entrepreneurs ought to be appreciated more in our community.

The ultimate success of the Entrepreneurs in Kentucky curriculum depends on the ability of the entrepreneurial program to elicit positive student attitudes and promote economic understanding. Further research will be conducted to determine the effects of the curriculum on a larger student population. Interviews of students, teachers, and entrepreneur partners, as well as observations of classrooms implementing the curriculum, are planned. These results will be combined to form statewide aggregate data for a more complete analysis of the implementation of the curriculum project."

Suggestions for Entrepreneur/Teacher Partnerships: The entrepreneur partner and teacher will have an initial meeting. At this meeting, the teacher should first explain plans for teaching entrepreneurship. Next, the entrepreneur partner should make suggestions about how business background, expertise, and experience might help the teacher teach the identified entrepreneurship lessons. Then an initial operational plan with a timeline should be developed. The operational plan should be mutually agreeable to both the entrepreneur and the teacher. Continually keep in mind that the plan can change as the operational plan is implemented. The following are specific suggestions for different ways that the entrepreneur partner might become involved in the teaching of entrepreneurship. However, these are only suggestions. The teacher and entrepreneur partner are encouraged to develop the activities and time commitments that fit their situation best.

Communicate with students via the Internet answering students' questions
Visit the classroom and talk to students.
Host a fieldtrip for the class to visit the entrepreneur's business.
Help students who are working on research projects that deal with entrepreneurship provide a history or case study of the business.
Demonstrate the interdependence of the business with other local, national, and perhaps international businesses.
Explain what employers look for in employees, such as education, training, experience, good work habits, and entrepreneurial characteristics; conduct mock employment interviews;
Describe how learning basic skills in mathematics and communications are important to successful entrepreneurs.
Give a personal history of education and work experience that led to the entrepreneur's present position."

Abstract: Two teachers created the idea of operating a herb-growing business in the elementary school for the purpose of teaching science, economics and the world of business. After a failing experience with growing plants in the classroom, they obtained help from a local greenhouse. By Mother's Day they were ready to sell their product successfully. Students learned how to package the plants, advertise them using technology resources, and sell to the public, and manage the money. When they ran out of pots they learned about supply and demand.

In the future the project will serve 65 students in three classrooms. Three classroom teachers will collaborate with four other special area teachers and special education teacher.. Other help will come from the science labe, the computer lab and the art teacher. This project addressed the areas of science, math, and writing which are part of the school's consolidated plan. Kentucky's Education Reform Act stresses the use of hands-on learning activities in math and science especially.

Abstract: Women's Initiative Networking Groups, Inc. (WINGS) was founded in 1994 by three women entrepreneurs from Kentucky's Appalachian region. The program is the result of their personal struggles while launching a business. Frustrated by their inability to find both sustained training resources and professional networks, they worked with a local community development organization to research methods that could effectively make entrepreneurship accessible and feasible to lower-income Appalachian women interested in more fulfilling lifestyles.

WINGS offers services to members in seven networks throughout Kentucky's 49 counties served by ARC. The entry point is a classroom training program. Four sessions are dedicated to personal life assessment, followed by eight sessions of business management training. Life assessment encourages each woman to evaluate her aptitude for self-employment and identify life priorities; business management teaches practical applications on such issues as operations, marketing, bookkeeping, etc. Classes are held twice a week, in three-hour sessions, and are facilitated by WINGS staff. At the training's conclusion, each participant drafts a business plan that includes a sales forecast, promotional plan, and expense budget.

Post-class activities consist of: regularly scheduled events and meetings to build networking capacity; individual consultations with staff specialists on marketing and financial strategies; referrals to local lending partners for start-up or expansion resources; and scholarship fund for continuing education.

Jeannie Brewer is WINGS' original executive director. Under her leadership, the program has reached over 250 individuals since services commenced in late 1995. WINGS' outreach efforts also include advocacy work on policy issues affecting women, leadership development projects, and international workshops with women activists in Tanzania and China."

The Market Place",none listed,"Focus: DECA Sales and Marketing Company (also known as ""The Market Place"")

Age Level: High school marketing education/DECA students, DECA associate members

Abstract: As a favor to the principal of the school, the DECA organization was asked to help get the yearbook out of debt so the school could begin to publish the books again. The class was organized into a business with various departments, concentrating on sales and service. The students became the outside sales people as well as being assigned a department such as development, marketing, design, and customer service. In one year, the yearbook went from having debt of $13,000 to breaking even.

Recognizing an opportunity (other than learning experiences), the students developed a proposal and presented it to the principal. They would continue to sell yearbook ads and take on the additional responsibility for a commission if they could form a business based on commission sales. The commission would be based on a sliding scale determined by the amount of ads sold. The business did not actually design the yearbook or take pictures, etc. Their business was simply sales, design of customer advertisements, promotion of ads, sales of the yearbooks, and customer service to the advertisers.

From this initial business venture, the company has grown and now offers sales and marketing services to all school-wide sales, most school club/organization sales, and feeder-school fundraising sales. The latest venture has been in marketing community activities.

Outcomes of the program include:

The business now markets and sells all schoolwide activities.
The business is now offering services in the feeder junior high and elementary schools.
Another business that has developed includes specialized gift sales. The company determines one to three items that would quickly sell at Christmas and/or graduation time and offer the items through the school and festivals being held during that time. The business works well with the historical society and helps with their promotion and sales—sometimes for a small commission and sometimes for civic responsibility. Results from those activities lead to other fundraising opportunities for students, such as cleaning and restoring a historical museum, working booths at one of the largest festivals in the area, etc. Several civic groups have recruited the services of the company to promote and sell various activities, such as the Redbud Festival, Antique Days, Vivian Christmas Festival, etc.

The business grew to include the sales and marketing of all school-sponsored activities. Students in the business develop and promote activities such as beauty pageants, suppers/dinners at school, dances, homecoming, and other specially designed activities. In addition to the promotion, the company handles all sales of tickets. A commission based upon sales is determined prior to the activity, which provides another learning experience for students. It also serves as a motivation for students.

The business also handles all school organization fundraising activities. They make presentations on the best type of fundraiser to have (candy, t-shirts, calendars, gifts, etc.), locate the appropriate vendor, and work out a better ""deal"" for the organization than the basic offer, and participate in the ordering, inventory, promotion, and collection for the fundraiser. The organization members actually do the selling of the product. When sales are slow, however, DECA members either help with sales or provide a new sales or motivational tool to stimulate members. A pre-determined sales commission is decided prior to each fundraising activity.

Terry Elmore is a marketing education teacher coordinator and DECA advisor. His background in marketing and strong rapport with civic and business community leaders have helped develop the sales company. North Caddo is a comprehensive high school located in a small town, serving surrounding townships. The visibility of the program and student involvement has secured community support. The teacher encourages and allows students to make the business decisions and determine growth of the company."

Abstract: This program and line of research looks at the efficacy of web-based youth entrepreneurship education at the high school level. A particular effort is put forth to gain understanding into the dynamics of entrepreneurship education as it relates to the 'big picture' in education - Does web-based entrepreneurship education have an effect on the learning of children at the secondary educational level? And if so, how?

Entrepreneurship educational research is central to many of the ideals of renewed education in the United States, and encompasses aspects of cognitive process and child development, curricular reinvention, and systemic educational change. In this project, students will be exposed to particular ""real-world"" problem scenarios, and interactively over time, work to solve the problem(s). The small group/individual high school students will work with one another to research, analyze, synthesize, and formulate a plan to attack the main problems they encounter and identify in the case scenario. The utilization of web-based resources, including posted articles, content specific media presentations and on-line expert email interactions will become the key ingredients in gaining an understanding of the problems they face. The student groups will work over a set period of time to ultimately formulate business plans and create and deliver presentations on their learning.

The culminating projects and presentations will encompass every aspect of a well-conceived business plan. The projects are developed so as to promote multi-disciplinary, holistic interaction of traditional subject matters (i.e. math, science, and language arts) into a smooth and seamless educational transition. High School education in the United States tends to follow a discipline-specific curriculum, with students learning to multiply and divide only in math class, read in English classes, and studying about organisms only in science class. The project seeks to ascertain the benefits of holistic and inter-disciplinary education, emphasizing innovation, creativity, and problem-solving skills, through the use of entrepreneurship education."

Abstract: The business originated as an Otis Spunkmeyer cookie-sales business. However, the agreement with the school was that the only sales that could be made at school would be done after the lunch shift. Therefore, the company became a direct-sales company, with each student responsible for promotion of sales outside of the school for one full week during the school year.

Because of weekly promotions, the company quickly expanded to include balloon bouquets, cookie bouquets, stuffed animals, etc., to meet the demands of the customers. Within the first year, the company became a catering company for local business meetings. Students secured the business, produced the menu, set up the dessert table, delivered the products, and served when asked.

The company is now more than a cookie, catering, and gift-sales company. This year it is becoming a sales and marketing company for other organizations at the school. The company will promote organizations' sales, secure the product (t-shirts, candy, etc.), track the inventory, sell, and close the sales projects.

Unique features include:

Cookies are sold in the community by students through promotion activities (cookies are not sold in school).
Every student is responsible for a one-week promotion in which he/she is in total charge of the entire activity, from creating the idea/promotion, to production, to consumption.
Because of the off-campus sales, other businesses have emerged, including Catepug Company, Balloon I Cookie/Gift Bouquets, Delivery Service.
The expansion of the business within the first year made the business more than a cookie factory at the school. No cookies were sold at school at the beginning of the business. When the business did begin selling them at school, the selling period was limited to only about 10–15 minutes each day.

All students are assigned a week during the school year to develop their own promotion for the cookie company. They have to decide upon the promotion, theme, products, supplies, budget, ordering, vendors, etc. It is their responsibility to determine the cost of the finished product and make the sales. Sometimes, the students lose money on their project, and if they do, are responsible for helping the next student make enough profit to cover their loss.

This business made an impression on the community. Students were soon called upon to cater meetings at the mayor's office, the Chamber of Commerce, and school board meetings. This led to civic groups contacting the business, and from this, the business has grown. Delivery service is an added benefit, and one that the students added to the mix."

Abstract: Entrepreneurship was added to Westgate's curriculum in the spring of 2008. The program is definitely in the ""infancy"" stages. This semester will be the second time the school offers the class and it has quickly become a class that fills up fast!

The entrepreneurship course was designed to help students explore the world of business ownership. It requires a lot of hand-on work, including the writing of a business plan at the culmination of the class. The following are some of the other highlighted activities from the class:

Hot Shot Business - Students are introduced to the world of business online in this Disney simulation.
Virtual Online Simulation Team Challenge - Students compete online in teams to earn the most profit for an event. The challenged is hosted by Deloitte.
Inventions/Patents - Students learn about the patent process and then develop an invention. Students conduct a patent search for their invention and create a prototype of their invention.
The Cookie Factory - Students create a completely new cookie to introduce to the market. They will develop a product line around their new cookie, advertise their product, and design a factory plan.
Business Plan - Students write a business plan for either their invention or for a service/product that interest them.
Westgate is a large, non-title one school in an area of south central Louisiana that has seen tremendous economic growth in the past few years. The entrepreneurship class began with an idea I had to bring experiential learning into the classroom. At the time I was teaching financial math and much of the material reminded me of parts of an entrepreneurship class I took in college. I saw how students were learning different aspects of business in their class but it was never all put together. I thought it would be awesome to have a class that brought all aspects of business together and give students an experience that could open up an opportunity for their future. I felt that an entrepreneurship class would meet that vision.

I brought my vision to our Principal in charge of curriculum and before long; Entrepreneurship was added as a class! This semester is only the second time I teach the class yet it has already inspired students. I am currently working with a student from my first class to patent and refine the manufacturing process for an invention she came up with as a result of being in my class.

I felt it was very important to teach students about businesses that stimulate the local economy. As a result we did a unit on inventions in which all students had to develop an invention and create a prototype of their invention. This student had an incredible idea that could possibly have a huge impact on that particular industry. This student is a senior and has decided to major in International Business in college and has a huge desire to see her invention become a viable business for her future. I am so excited just thinking of the possibilities she will have as she goes off to college and gains greater business knowledge to see her product into a business.

This semester, I have a student whose family owns two local clothing stores. He has expressed his desire to expand and open up his own shop when he graduates next year but lacks the confidence in himself to be out on his own. I feel this class will be exactly what he will need! He will be writing a business plan, which will greatly help him to focus his ideas and bring everything together. It might just be the confidence boost he will need to be successful.

With all the excitement surrounding this entrepreneurship class, I realize that I still have a lot to learn as teacher. I want this class to be effective, inspiring, and provide students with an opportunity to change their future. It has been awesome to see how students that do not like school take interest in this class. I feel entrepreneurship is going to be a huge part of a successful future and by exposing students to that in school; we are increasing the opportunity for success."

It is owned solely by the residents and graduates of Alliance House, a staff-secure, short-term assessment and intervention for adolescent males age 13 to 17 years referred by the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services.

Alliance All Purpose is a real corporation, owned by the residents and graduates of Alliance House. It is separated into two divisions: the Resident Division and the Senior Division. The Resident Division is for Alliance House residents, all of whom must participate in the business. The Senior Division is for Alliance House graduates, who, after they leave, continue working with the business either full-time or part-time. The goal of the Senior Division is aftercare—to keep former residents employed, to reinforce positive behavior they learned at Alliance House, and to provide daily support.

Each Alliance House resident is a stockholder and Alliance All-Purpose owner. The stockholders meet every Monday morning for one hour. There is a five-member board that includes up to two Senior Division members. The board is elected by the stockholders and holds weekly meetings to decide policy issues. At the end of each month, after all expenses are paid, the net profits are divided among stockholders according to the numbers of hours they worked during the month. A portion of the proceeds of each job are kept in the business.

The classroom is used as a business training ground where the basic skills for running business are taught. The residents who attend school 5 to 7 hours daily learn basic accounting, marketing, and computer skills and customer relations skills. For example, a math class on work problems emphasizes how to calculate a job bid.

In the future, Alliance All-Purpose hopes to start a bank modeled after the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh. It will be available to those in the Senior Division. Those starting a business will be assigned a professional mentor and will meet with others in teams. Alliance All-Purpose will be part of PBS's This Old House programs."

Abstract: In 1998–1999, we ran two pilot programs in the Fashion Trades/Retail Merchandising program (F.A.D.). We introduced the NFTE (National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship) curriculum and purchased a Tajima TMEX-C1200 commercial embroidery machine.

Our original purpose was to enhance the Fashion Trades/Retail Merchandising program with a training that would give our students a competitive edge over any other applicant in a retail setting. The entrepreneurship instruction would make our students better employees, even if they did not develop the desire to start their own business. The embroidery machine would give the students an opportunity to learn to design and create a multitude of products, from logo clothing to personalized blankets to hats and gift items.

As the program took form, we saw the two components offer the students one of three options:

They could start their own business using the embroidery machine to create unique products for a niche market that the student would be responsible for defining
They could work for F.A.D. Embroidery Service selling retail through our own school store or personal contacts
They could be a part of the F.A.D. Embroidery Wholesale Service.
The wholesale business sells logo hats, clothing, and fleece blankets to other school stores in the network of schools and community centers in western Massachusetts participating in the NFTE program. The wholesale business also sells personalized products and special orders to area gift shops. This year, the F.A.D. Embroidery Service added a Web page advertising the products and services available.

Through the Web site, a potential customer can see a sampling of the products offered, and contact us for a brochure. The Web site development was a senior project for one of the F.A.D. students.

Upon completion of the program, a trained student can take one of three routes. He/she can start his/her own business by buying or leasing a machine; find employment at any of a few embroiderers in the area (at well over the typical minimum wage); or go for additional training as a technician with the Tajima company.

Gayle Wilson Hsiao is an instructor at the Career and Technical Education Center, the vocational high school for the Lower Pioneer Valley Educational Collaborative.

MA,Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Entrepreneurship Center,http://entrepreneurship.mit.edu,"Abstract: The mission of the MIT Entrepreneurship Center is to train and develop leaders who will make high-tech ventures successful. To that end, we offer educational programs to inspire, train, and coach new generations of entrepreneurs from all parts of MIT.

The MIT Sloan School of Management ranks among the top educational and research institutes in the world. This claim is possible because the university boasts an outstanding and committed faculty. Over 25 faculty members specialize in entrepreneurship or new ventures.

To sustain and expand the entrepreneurial, creative tradition, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology established the MIT Entrepreneurship Center with seed funding from the Kauffman Foundation's Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership, the Coleman Foundation, and the Lemelson Foundation. Located at the MIT Sloan School of Management, the interdisciplinary center provides a central focus for the broad and growing array of activities, programs, and resources in entrepreneurship from all the schools and departments of the institute, as well as from the broader venture community. The center works actively to design and implement novel education and research programs that will lay the groundwork for the future practice of entrepreneurship.

If the companies founded by MIT graduates and faculty formed an independent nation, the revenues produced by the companies would make that nation the 24th-largest economy in the world. A 1996 study prepared by the Economics Department of Bank Boston found that the 4,000 MIT-related companies that exist today employ 1.1 million people and have annual world sales of $232 billion. That is roughly equal to a gross domestic product of $116 billion, which is a little less than the1996 GDP of South Africa and more than that of Thailand.

Since MIT was founded by an act of the Massachusetts state legislature, entrepreneurship has been a core value of the MIT culture. The act established MIT for ""the advancement, development, and practical application of science in connection with arts, agriculture, manufactures, and commerce."" In this spirit, MIT scientists, engineers, and managers believe that it is not enough merely to invent a new product, concept, or technology. The measure of success is global commercialization and widespread acceptance of their innovations. The MIT Entrepreneurship Center works to coordinate and strengthen this vital force, to promote a better understanding of it, and to promulgate the lessons learned for the benefit of all. In the process, faculty develop new paradigms for teaching students how to be successful high-tech entrepreneurs.

MIT's entrepreneurship professors and instructors use a variety of teaching methods: case studies, internships, external review of student assignments by venture capitalists, guest lectures, and student projects. All courses involve teamwork and a focus on presentation skills.

The Lemelson-MIT Prize Program was created in 1994 to encourage young Americans to pursue careers in science, technology, and entrepreneurship. The program awards the world's largest prize for invention and innovation, the half-million-dollar Lemelson-MIT Prize, as well as MIT student awards for inventiveness and doctoral fellowships seeking to create a more innovative and entrepreneurial environment in the United States.

The MIT $50,000 Entrepreneurship Competition is an annual student-run competition that provides resources and inspiration to encourage students and researchers in the MIT community to act on their energy, ideas, and talent to produce tomorrow's leading firms. Judges drawn from business angels, venture capitalists, successful entrepreneurs, and professional-services firms award $50,000 in cash and business services to the three winning teams. In its nine-year history, over 30 companies have sprung out of the competition. These ventures have received over $185 million in capital investment and created over 300 jobs."

This widespread support for entrepreneurship education provides a rich context for the work of the Springfield Technical Community College School of Business and Informational Technology's Entrepreneurial Institute.

The Entrepreneurial Institute provides a ""one stop"" approach to entrepreneurial education for entrepreneurs who seek start-up or growth knowledge and information. Credit and non-credit courses are offered by a well-balanced team of specialized professionals in all subjects relating to new business start-ups and ongoing small businesses. The Entrepreneurial Institute also offers interdisciplinary programs involving experiential learning, internships, and cooperatives which enable people to learn first-hand the anguish and joys of starting and growing their own businesses.

Reaching into the community in order to increase the stream of new entrepreneurs who can grow and develop new companies, the Entrepreneurial Institute functions as a coalescing force in the development and delivery of entrepreneurial education across the spectrum of present and future business owners.

Located on both the campus of Springfield Technical Community College and the STCC Technology Park, the Entrepreneurial Institute will serve as an integral part of the College's Springfield Enterprise Center by providing one-on-one individual advising and a full range of information and services for present and future entrepreneurs. As part of an innovative partnership between business and education, the Entrepreneurial Institute is prepared to foster and support economic development in the region at the K-8, postsecondary and adult levels.

Mr. Thomas Goodrow was the co-founder of the Entrepreneurial Institute at Springfield Technical Community College (STCC) in November 1996, in collaboration with entrepreneur/educator Dr. Stephen Spinelli, Jr., Professor, Babson College. Dedicated to promulgating entrepreneurship education, the Entrepreneurial Institute at STCC serves as a ""one-stop"" center of entrepreneurship education for present and future business owners.

These programs include a Student Incubator, which is one of only a handful in the country at the community college level. Mr. Goodrow has successfully raised over 1.5 million dollars from private and public foundations, as well as securing additional individual donations from area entrepreneurs in support of expanding the Entrepreneurial Institute to meet the rapidly growing demand for entrepreneurship education.

This program highlights the evolutionary process of building a student business incubation program, as part of a K-14 student entrepreneurship education pipeline, in partnership with institutions of higher education.

Abstract: As one of two teachers in the program I teach Entrepreneurship to my Junior class. We start by teaching basic Intro to Business skills. We move into writing a business plan. The students then do fundraising to get money to start their businesses. They purchase their goods to create their product with the monies they raised. The students then have the opportunity to sell their products and services to the whole school for two days and they get to keep their profits. They have to market their products and in the end they then create a profit and loss statement. A pair of students who started a business selling Russian Pastry made about $400.00 in two days.

We are a very small school. We are not regionalized and we draw most of our students from Westfield. The bulk of community support goes to the High School, not the Vocational school. I am trying to show the community that students at the Vocational School can be just as successful as the students in a traditional high school. The mindset of people in this community is that the voke school is for students who cannot cut it at the high school.

I owned and operated my own business for 15 years prior to teaching about 14 years ago. I took cooperative education students into my business and felt that I could make a difference in their lives and wanted to give back to students the knowledge I gained over the years. I have been at this present school for 6 years.

My students have designed the school website along with maintaining it. Prior to that, the school did not have a website. Our students now graduate with career portfolios. I was instrumental in the school adopting this graduation requirement. I started the school chapter of FBLA and am now the state of Massachusetts chairperson for FBLA. I am working hard to bring FBLA back into the state. We started a school store and the students in business technology do all of the aspects related to running a business (the store). As so many public schools are experiencing today, our school has had problems with funding. Our school store has been instrumental in supplying the funds necessary to run our program."

Abstract: BizE is a new young entrepreneur/inventor initiative developed by Angela Egner and being piloted at three Michigan schools through a partnership with the Genesee Area Focus Council.

BizE's innovative curriculum is designed to facilitate the development of entrepreneurial know-how while honing academic skills. BizE is comprehensive in that it provides multi-grade level curriculum that may be implemented sequentially or as standalone programs. The curriculum may begin as early as third grade and continue through high school, with distinct course content, skill-development, and teaching techniques at each level. Action-packed and engaging, the curriculum is fresh, fun, and powerful.

Recognizing the importance of technology development in America's free enterprise system, BizE has also developed a specific program called Invent, Inc., which uniquely combines entrepreneurship with the invention process.

BizE materials were developed with the intense involvement of a team of teacher consultants involved in the pilot effort. Its lessons have been mapped to the Michigan Curriculum Framework, as well as national economic education standards.

All BizE programs will be available in two formats (20 and 40 hours) to meet a wide-range of instructional formats, timetables and needs. Detailed lesson plans and rubrics are provided for various requirements, including classroom, after-school, summer program or camp formats. Additionally, BizE provides superb instructor workshops and onsite planning support.

BizE will be offered to other Michigan schools in 2003 and available nationally in 2004.

Student Programs (Work texts and Instructor Manuals) are as follows:

Show 'N Sell (Level 1: Grades 3 - 6) Elementary youth are introduced to entrepreneurship with the creation of a themed classroom business that makes and markets its products or services. Production and marketing are emphasized. Strong vocabulary, reading, research and math curriculum connections.
Invent, Inc. (Level 2: Grades 5 - 8+) Upper elementary and middle-school youth engage in the invention process as they explore entrepreneurship. Students are organized into themed teams that invent marketable products. Heavy science concentration, with math and writing also emphasized.
Venture-Out (Level 3: Grade 7-10+) Young teens discover their own abilities, opportunities, and ambitions as they develop independent businesses. Business planning, marketing and finance are emphasized, with academic skill development in all curriculum areas.

MI,Branch Area Careers Center,"www.branch-isd.org (go to Career/Tech Education, then daytime programs, then Marketing, Management & Entrepreneurship)","Focus: Marketing, Management & Entrepreneurship class

Geographic Area: Rural area of Central Michigan

Age Level:The students enrolled in MME are mainly eleventh and twelfth graders.

Abstract: Approximately 25 - 50 students each year are enrolled in the classes; approximately 38% have been Special Ed, At-Risk, ESL, early placement, or have a learning disability. The students are from a rural area and are diversified in achievement levels, family income levels and continuing educational goals. They are in the Business Management, Marketing and Technologies career pathway; desiring to go into the field of business, with the majority aiming to own their own business.

The Marketing, Management & Entrepreneurship class is dedicated to providing rewarding, fulfilling, motivating and technical education. As a motivating and forward moving program we have a significant and positive impact on the attitude and subsequently the achievement of the students. The lessons present marketing and entrepreneurship with encouragement for cooperative learning and stimulation of interaction.

Because of our program's dedication to quality education in preparing students for their future, we have incorporated the ""Teaching Success"" entrepreneurship curriculum into the program to develop student business ventures into the curriculum. The students complete an 18-week entrepreneurship project. The program begins with assessments of entrepreneurial skills. The students complete a self assessment by examining their personalities, determination, problem solving skills, drive, planning and organizational skills, creativity, as well as other strengths and weaknesses. Students consider the needs for their business, analyzing the market, the demand for their business, the location if outside of the classroom, the budget, the laws and regulations, and the promotional needs. Our class incorporates the knowledge and techniques of outstanding entrepreneurs in the business field. This leads students to master the art of creating new endeavors. Built on interaction, in this program, students work together to acquire knowledge and the requisite skills to take their imaginations to a new plane: to put their ideas into action.

To improve the students' learning,we take a new and more student-friendly approach to entrepreneurship. Students may gain valuable learning experiences by reading about starting a business. They may also gain more by doing classroom activities. But actually beginning their very own business and experiencing first hand what it takes to be in business, is better than any simulation could ever present.

It is designed to foster academic applications to work experiences.
It enhances the understanding of business practices.
It enriches the students' knowledge of better business management.
It promotes students' desires to succeed in the business world. It expands business opportunities.
It provides students with the skills and confidences to compete in the marketplace.
It expands awareness of business ethnics and diversity through first hand experiences.
Our students participate in an annual competition: Generation E Showcase. It highlights student-operated business ventures from around the state by awarding cash prizes for the most sustainable businesses and for outstanding business plans. Students not only create their business plans and start up a business venture, but make presentations to the judges. While at this event, they also attend workshops and hear from nationally known, successful, young entrepreneurs. Each of the three years that the Showcase has been offered, our students have returned with at least four winning businesses.

Because of the recognition of our success, we are now in the process of establishing a local, county-wide expo. We are working with our local Home Town Competitiveness committee, the Chamber of Commerce, local businesses, local high schools, and local colleges to create a combined effort for a day to introduce younger students to the world of entrepreneurship and to highlight our own achievements. We have also received guidance from Kent State University in Ohio and Generation E. Our students will present and display their businesses.

This year we were invited to attend the IIEE (Illinois Institute of Entrepreneur Education). It was an experience that gave students an opportunity to present their businesses to others outside of the state. Workshops and speakers also enlightened and expanded the students' knowledge.

We also are members and supporters of DECA (An Association of Marketing Students). Each year we have competed and have had students succeed to participation in the ICDC (International Career Development Conference). Students have taken their entrepreneurship skills to the competition by completing one of the entrepreneurship written events."

MI,Generation E Institute,www.genei.org,"Abstract: Generation E began as a youth program focusing on middle and high school students. The students learn how to unleash their imaginations and develop business ideas. After following the manual from ideas to business plans, the students operate their own business/service. Building on that success and reputation, the Institute has expanded to customizing programs for community organizations

The Generation E Institute has two copyrighted curricula: New Directions: Beginning Entrepreneurial Education (middle school curriculum) and New Directions in Entrepreneurship Education (high school and young adult curriculum). Both curricula have been developed to align with the National Content Standards and Benchmarks for Entrepreneurship Education, as well as the Michigan Career and Employability Content Standards and Benchmarks. Recently the high school curriculum was recognized as fulfilling .5 credits in the English Language Arts requirement due to the research, writing, communication, and higher levels of cognitive learning skills contained in the curriculum.

Because of its hands-on activity based structure, educators are certified through a two-day training. Following the initial training we work with the educator or group to customize the curriculum to fit the individual needs of their program. As explained below, that occurs in the second step of the Generation E approach. Community involvement, support and volunteerism are built into the curriculum. The instruction as to how to accomplish this is done during the initial certification training but continues beyond the training to develop a working relationship with the community and to create sustainability for the program within each organization.

The Generation E Institute has developed a three step approach for the delivery entrepreneurship education. The first step is to assist communities and organizations to determine the ""pockets of entrepreneurs."" Before the program begins in schools or group settings, we meet with the appropriate organizations, school administrators, community members, etc., to establish community support in terms of mentors as well as financial contributors.

The second step is to certify the designated educators and to customize the curricula to fit their unique needs.

The third step is to work with the educators, community leaders, businesses, and local organizations to ensure mentors, volunteers and general community support is in place. To assure sustainability we assist in establishing student loan funds, interviewing experiences, internships, possible student incubator sites and student expos or showcases within their community, district or region.

This practice attracted other organizations, asking for customized assistance. The Generation E staff now offers consulting services to many community organizations. After school programs, church affiliated groups, work force development, at-risk populations, summer camps; the list is endless as to individuals who can benefit from entrepreneurship education. Customizing trainings, coaching and mentoring organizations that wish to support individuals as they develop an entrepreneurial mindset have led to Generation E expanding its offerings.

In its fourth year of operation, the Generation E Institute for Entrepreneurship Education is based in Battle Creek, Michigan. As a 501 (c) (3), the Institute has certified over 250 educators and community volunteers, reached over 3,000 youth and young adults and has presented three annual student business showcases awarding over $18,000 in cash prizes to young entrepreneurs. The end result is consistency; constantly leading towards ""making a job, not just taking a job."""

Geographic Area: Genesee, Shiawassee, Oakland, and Lapeer Counties of Michigan.

Age Level: Girls age 5 through 18

Abstract: We are developing an age-appropriate entrepreneurial education and economic empowerment curriculum for girls grade K–12. Last year we served over 400 girls in the counties surrounding the city of Flint. We would like to expand this program and train other Girl Scout Councils across the country. To date, this is the only formal entrepreneurial education program within a Girl Scout council.

All programs target females from all racial, ethnic, religious, and economic backgrounds. We also offer special programs that target teen moms and bilingual migrant students.

Description of the programs:

Business Fun—Camp 0' Fair Winds: Two-week business camp for girls in grades 4–6. The business curriculum teaches the young girls how to start a business, create a business plan, and find financing options, as well as increase their self-esteem through high ropes and climbing walls.
Camp $tart-Up—The Timbers Camp: Two-week business camp for girls in grades 7–12. The business curriculum integrates teaching material from Independent Means, Inc. Local businesswomen interact with the girls and assist them in creating a business plan, and learning economic empowerment.
Teen Mom Program; Eigh-week educational series during the school day for teen moms, teaching business ownership, writing a business plan, and resources to get started.
Miscellaneous programs: Various workshops and programs are offered throughout the school year to Brownies and Girl Scouts, as well as non-Girl Scouts. The objectives of these programs are to (1) make girl-oriented economic education accessible to the community at large, (2) increase the economic literacy skills of the girl participants, and (3) provide women business owners as role models to young girls."
MI,Ishpeming High School,none listed,"Focus: High School Students

Abstract: REAL Entrepreneur is a two semester class. Students who have taken the class may sign up for it again to continue where they left off the previous time. This class is designed to develop entrepreneurial talent, knowledge, skills and attitudes and guides the student through the process of planning, creating, and operating a small business of their own design using experiential (hands-on) learning. It mirrors the real world.

This will be its fourth year of operation. The class as a whole plans, organizes and operates a school store which is housed in the new gym, a student credit union, which is a full-service credit union open to students, faculty and alumni, and a small business service center located in our downtown. Students have the opportunity to learn a position or positions in any of these businesses. Students signing up for the second year of entrepreneurship will enforce the skills they learned previously by ""training in"" the new students in the positions of the businesses. Then the second year students will learn another aspect of the business.

Second and third year students may also open and operate their own business upon completion of a community analysis and business plan. This is not a requirement, but an opportunity available through the class based on their business plan idea and approval of the teacher and school. Students who open their own businesses will gain valuable knowledge for their future. They will be partnered with a business leader in our community to mentor and assist them through the process, along with classroom assistance and training.

Many students have had the opportunity to own and operate their own businesses through this program. Student businesses have included: web page design, hand made jewelry, a dance studio, historical walking tour, homework service, desktop publishing, and personal shopping service to name a few. As in real life the student businesses may be successful or not successful, but either way the students gain valuable experiences about real-life business for their future.

MN,Susan B Anthony Community Middle School,none listed,"Focus: Middle school entrepreneurship course

Abstract: This is the third year that the Owning Your Own Business class has been offered as a semester elective at Anthony Middle School, which is part of the Minneapolis Public School System. Each class has served as least 25 students. The main curriculum used comes from NFTE (National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship) materials.

Local entrepreneurs are invited in weekly to speak to students and answer their questions. Every student is required to complete their own business plan and present their plan to a panel of judges from the community. A local business called MEDA (Metropolitan Economic Development Association—a nonprofit organization that helps adults start their own business—provides volunteers to act as consultants to the students.

Students learn the basic skills required to complete a business plan, as well as negotiating and bookkeeping skills. In addition, students learn how to calculate costs and expenses and how to manage their time and market their business ideas. Students not only learn the basics of starting a business but also have the opportunity to develop their communication and presentation skills, as they are required to verbally and graphically present their business plan. With the help of the financial services community, students visit the trading floor of a major brokerage firm and have a segment on basic investing. Students also play a stock market game by selecting stocks and monitoring their investments.

Presently the OYOB program is the only entrepreneurship program being taught at any level in the Minneapolis Public School System. This program requires substantial additional outside funding, as we receive no money from Minneapolis Public Schools. All funding comes from the business community; we are required to raise all funds needed to teach this program. I have done so by writing grants and explaining my program to members of the business community. In the long term, I would like to be a mentor for teachers in the Minneapolis school district who are interested in teaching entrepreneurship."

MO,Carthage Technical Center,www.carthage.k12.mo.us/tc/,"Abstract: Carthage Technical Center is located in the heart of Carthage, Missouri. Carthage is a relatively small community of 12,000 people located in the southwest corner of the state where the grassland prairies meet the traditional Ozark uplands. Carthage Technical Center serves our own high school population as well as students from Avilla, Jasper, and Webb City. Carthage R-9 is also comprised of a junior high school, and five elementary schools, grades K-6. Our school district enrollment totals 3,898.

Students come largely from families of blue-collar workers and a large percentage of those students are employed to help with family support. The makeup of our community at present is heavily industrial and agricultural. Carthage is the home of Leggett & Platt's world headquarters and 40 other much smaller industries. At the present time our Technical Center staff, along with Advisory Committees for each of our programs, is looking for ways to retain the ""cream"" of our graduating crop. We feel that this could be accomplished by offering hands-on experience in a school-based business and continued instruction of an entrepreneurial nature.

""TigerGear"" became my entrepreneurship students' business of choice for a way to ""connect"" with the student body, community, faculty, administration, and athletes. The lack of ""Spirit"" gear and products was a noticeable hole in our school culture. This group of students started with an idea and worked through the entrepreneurial concept from inception to culmination. They also designed and devised an online catalog our district allowed to be placed on the district website."

Abstract: The goal of the Clayton School District is to recognize individual differences and to provide each child with a positive and complete educational experience. The district participates in the voluntary transfer program with the City of St. Louis. Clayton High School serves a diverse population of students that includes children who speak 28 different languages and originate from 30 different countries. This is due in part to the presence of a major university, a college, and a seminary within the District's boundaries. Entrepreneurship serves this diverse population. The class is a mixture of various races and nationalities. It also serves Special School District and English as Second Language students.

Most students may not start their own business but I still feel that it is essential that they be exposed to the idea and learn what is involved. This experience will help them have a better understanding of business. For this class, all of my students prepare a prospectus to start a new business. They go through the entire process from selecting a location, to developing a product, studying the market, identifying customers, selecting location, looking at legal restrictions, developing promotion, and determining financing.

Clayton's program is quite unique. The class meeting schedule is different from most schools. All classes are one semester in length. All the students enrolled in a particular class meet together one morning before school. Students then come to small group sessions during their lunch hour on either A or B days. This type of scheduling allows for great flexibility when working with the students as a whole group or working with a small group of students in the informal lunch sessions (students bring in their lunch and eat during class). This type of schedule was initiated because it was difficult for students to fit the classes into their schedule. 98% of the students who graduated from CHS in 2000 went to college and a majority of our students take AP/Honors courses. In 2000, 289 AP tests were taken with 86% passing with a score of 3, 4, or 5. (Leading Educational Indicators of Student Success, 1999-2000 Assessment Study, Clayton School District) This type of flexible schedule allows students to take the courses in our program.

Several of my students have actually used their prospectus to gain financing and are now operating their own business. Another way that the impact of our program on student achievement can be seen is through the college admissions and career selections of our students. As previously stated, 98% of our students went on to college. Of the students enrolled in our program last year, all students were admitted to college and the vast majority of those students were intending to declare business as their major.

My program was also featured as a cover story on Channel 5. This generated a great deal of discussion in the community and many positive responses from parents. In the story, I was interviewed about the program, my classroom and its activities were featured, and individual students were also interviewed.

Another innovative activity that is conducted is the New York Field Trip. The philosophy of our trip is to provide students with meaningful access to the leading professionals in the marketing, management, and entrepreneurship fields, as well as exposure to the realities of the business environment. The purpose of the trip is to educate and enrich students by effectively extending the realm of the classroom. The trip that we take includes seminars and workshops with some of the world's leading designers, boutique owners, and store owners. All the seminar leaders are open and honest about the realities of their field in terms of salaries, competition, training required and career opportunities. Students come away from the seminars with very deep and rich impressions of the various entrepreneurial opportunities. In some cases, students have determined more clearly whether or not they would like to pursue a certain career.

We also work with the AAJM Management Association, Xerox, and the St. Louis Rams Foundation to take students on field trips and seminars through the Future Executives program. Students participate in a monthly activity where they have the opportunity to gain a better understanding of business needs and see on an individual basis how business functions on a day-to-day basis. Students visit with entrepreneurs at both large and small businesses."

I am currently the Director of our Breech School of Business that houses 600 plus majors and has a required course in entrepreneurship that I frequently teach. Finally, we've recently added an Entrepreneurship Center that I helped create, including acquiring the naming gift and working with key individuals to launch the Center. The Center is home of our interdisciplinary minor in Entrepreneurship and our MBA program that has an Entrepreneurship concentration. I also work with our Edward Jones Minority Scholars who all minor in Entrepreneurship.

Drury's SIFE team has won three SIFE USA National Championships and has helped thousands of people from numerous countries. Their current work includes an entrepreneurial endeavor to help impoverished people around the globe manufacturer and sell a source for clean drinking water. To date, this project has been implemented in at least 5 countries with more on the horizon. Additionally, the team has pioneered collegiate incubation and hosts a large non-profit incubator on its campus. The team conducts approximately 40 projects each year, with many, if not a majority, of them containing an entrepreneurship emphasis.

The Edward Jones Center for Entrepreneurship is fairly new, originating in 2007, but has already started to impact the campus culture and the surrounding areas. In addition to the Minority Scholars program referenced earlier, the Center is currently helping to host the University's Convocation Series this year, consisting of nationally-known speakers in the area of Entrepreneurship and Innovation. Additionally, the Center has provided a workshop for non-business faculty to help them implement entrepreneurial ideas in their curriculum and has ambitious plans for future expansion."
MO,First Step Fund,www.firststepfasttrac.org,"Abstract: The First Step FastTrac program, developed by the Kauffman Foundation, assists prospective small business owners in determining the feasibility of their business idea and writing a basic plan for that business. Its focus on feasibility makes it particularly useful in the community college and high school setting, as it establishes an informed decision making process that participants can use for any business opportunity. It is a perfect companion to a technical education program. Many of those participants do not want to start their own business immediately after graduation, and thus lack the motivation to complete a full business plan. However, the feasibility plan allows them to ""know what they will need to know"" when and if they do want to start a business.

Over 100 sites are certified in its use across the US. Built on a highly interactive format, the 33 hour program can easily be expanded into a sixteen week curricula and used as a for credit or non-credit course at the community college level. It is based on an eighth grade literacy level, making it more accessible for a wider audience than many of the business texts available."
MO,Francis Howell High School,www.fhsds.k12.mo.us,"Business Entrepreneurship (formerly Business Enterprise) is a program for juniors and seniors from a broad range of socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds and many of the students are interested in some form of business as a career. We have a mix of high achieving students and those with lower GPAs and have learned that grades are not necessarily a factor in the success of someone interested in becoming an entrepreneur.

The primary goal for this program (course) has been to introduce students to our nation's free enterprise system and to the study of entrepreneurship. The students operate a student company in which they elect officers, decide what items to sell, how much to sell them for, how to market the items, and how much profit (or loss) was made. They also create an annual report for their company.

Students have won numerous awards for their companies including highest sales in the Eastern Missouri area and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places for their annual reports. Depending on the school year, I will have 5 or 6 classes and half are operating their businesses at the same time. My student company with the highest sales was a company that sold hoodies that they had designed and had gross sales of $21,000.

We currently have the students create a business where they are responsible for all aspects of their company, from product decisions, company name, financials, marketing, etc. One of the updates I would like to see made to the curriculum is to give our students an opportunity to individually or on a smaller team, create real businesses of their choosing. Currently decisions are made as a class but I feel that it leaves out many students who may have different interests or ideas. With the state of our country's economy at the moment it is important to teach entrepreneurship as it becomes an even more important element of our economic growth and development. More students will be working towards self-employment and entrepreneurship classes will give them the tools necessary to be successful."

Age Level: 11th and 12th grade

Abstract: Students in 11th or 12th grade may enroll. There are no prerequisites, but access to a computer is required. This semester-long class starts with an overview of entrepreneurship, including definitions, cases, and characteristics. After a brief introduction to economics, students begin developing a business plan that can be used to obtain financing and win suppliers, prospective employees, and customers. This is achieved using a step-by-step format, completing a project, and answering questions for each section. At the end of the semester, students correct and resubmit the plan in its entirety for final evaluation.

Students may easily format their class business plan into a written project for DECA competition. Students also get opportunity to speak with entrepreneurs through guest speakers and assignment formats. Opportunities exist to attend a chamber of commerce meeting, and to learn about various careers in areas such as property management, insurance, accounting, commercial banking, etc. There is no textbook, so all materials are generated by instructor through print, Internet, and actual company materials. An advisory board is used to lend authenticity.

Priese has a firm belief that this type of education is the most valuable type, because it promotes free enterprise, student individuality, and good self-esteem, and applies core learning to student-based interests."

Abstract: Carpenter? Lawyer? Chemist? Entrepreneur! In the American Dream Youthpreneurship Program students realize entrepreneurship as a career alternative and see that any interest can present an opportunity for self-employment. The American Dream Youthpreneurship Program begins with teachers of any discipline learning the fundamentals of entrepreneurship and then integrating it into their curriculum. Students in these teachers' classes attend the Entrepreneurship Institute. In the spring, they may enter the Entrepreneurship Competition, where they can compete for seed-money or scholarship awards.

Teacher Education
The program begins with a three-credit graduate course offered over one week in August and continued throughout the fall semester with ten to twelve hours of class and meeting time. The course is offered to high school teachers throughout the St. Louis area regardless of the teacher's discipline. Each teacher is required to incorporate entrepreneurship education into his or her class throughout the semester. Teachers are also required to submit an implementation plan for incorporating entrepreneurship into their curriculum, a journal recording the successes and challenges of their implementation plan and an evaluation device. Although these materials are not published, they are distributed to teachers in subsequent Teaching Entrepreneurship classes as guides in their own teaching. The course is taught by university faculty from the Center for Entrepreneurship and Economic Education with selected entrepreneurs and experts in entrepreneurship education serving as guest lecturers.

Entrepreneurship Institute
This two-day institute is offered in late fall and is open to the participating teachers and the students enrolled in their classes. Students and teachers must attend both days. During the first day of the institute, students meet with area entrepreneurs, attend class to review the concepts of business development, and form groups to develop a business proposal and presentation. After refining their proposals and presentations for three weeks, students attend the second day of the institute where they again meet with entrepreneurs. They make their business presentations, first within their class of students. Small business development professionals and entrepreneurs are on hand to nominate those businesses that will go forward to present to the entire institute.

Entrepreneurship Competition
In the spring, student entrepreneurs assemble at the university to present their businesses to commercial loan officers, representatives of the Small Business Administration, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and other interested parties. In addition to these networking opportunities, a panel of judges chooses the Young Entrepreneurs of the Year and runners up in two separate divisions: scholarship and start-up. Student presentations consist of a description of their good or service, a sample of their product, their business plan, their marketing plan and any other information they deem necessary to sell their product idea. Students receive assistance in preparing their presentation from their teachers or other mentors."

Abstract: The ABC (Attendance/Behavior/Character) = KIDS and CO. Project serves students from kindergarten to 12th grade, who have an active role in this program. Wellston School District has a population of 900 at-risk African-American minority students—living in an urban setting just recently declared an economic empowerment zone—who are impacted by this program's existence.

The ABC=KIDS and CO. Project's overall purpose is to teach entrepreneurial skills to at-risk youths from kindergarten through high school in the Wellston School District. The program:

introduces low-income students to the world of business and entrepreneurship by teaching them how to develop a small business;
enables students to learn the concepts of self-esteem, self-sufficiency, and a free market society
provides basic educational skills, including reading, writing, math, social studies, and public speaking through entrepreneurship education;
gives students the opportunity to develop and demonstrate critical and creative thinking skills and is a school-to-work transition opportunity.
The ABC=KIDS and CO. project provides opportunities for all participating students at each school to focus on improved Attendance (A), improved Behavior (B), and Character development (C) and to extend student learning beyond the classroom via opportunities to use academic skills and real-life knowledge to become mini-entrepreneurs in KIDS and CO.

This program is unique because it is the only one of its kind in our area that has a behavior modification component connected with it. We are the only entrepreneurial program that has been featured on the front page of our major newspaper, the Post-Dispatch (issued Friday, November 29, 1996). ABC=KIDS and CO. is a collaborative effort involving the Wellston School District, the business community, college serving groups, senior volunteers, the community at large, the Jefferson-Smurfit Center for Entrepreneurial Studies housed on the St. Louis University campus, and the St. Louis Enterprise Community."

Abstract: Based in the Center for Economic Development at Delta State University, the FastTrac program in the Mississippi Delta has become an innovative program for encouraging entrepreneurship. FastTrac is a program of the Entrepreneurial Education Foundation, which is funded by private foundation resources through the Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership (CEL) Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City, Missouri. The CEL was founded to serve as a catalyst for understanding, supporting, and accelerating entrepreneurship in America to fulfill the mission of self-sufficient people in ""healthy"" communities.

Premier FastTrac is two programs: FastTrac I, which assists potential entrepreneurs and FastTrac II, which is designed for individuals who already have a business. The FastTrac program is an educational process much like other courses in an educational setting; it is based on pertinent, logical, and timely business issues. The program helps launch or grow a business through practical business management skills used by leading entrepreneurial firms. All FastTrac programs combine interactive instruction with one-on-one coaching, peer learning, guest speakers, and comprehensive workbooks. FastTrac I is based on nine sessions where perspective entrepreneurs prepare a feasibility plan for their new business. FastTrac II is based on 11 sessions where entrepreneurs already in business receive information on strategies for business development and higher levels of success.

Over 16,000 entrepreneurs have graduated from programs in more than 30 states and Canada. Seventy-four percent of FastTrac program graduates are still operating profitably after six years. The program in the Mississippi delta began in 1995. During 1995–96, 75 people enrolled in the program, with 59 graduating. During 1996–97, 84 enrolled, with 74 completing the program."

Abstract: Economic Alternatives, established in 1994 in Holly Springs, Mississippi, was a concrete response to the employment needs in Marshall County. Marshall County, which borders Tennessee, at one time had one of the higher unemployment rates in the state. Only 25 percent of the population had a high school diploma or equivalent, and 6.3 percent of the population had a bachelor's degree.

Per capita income in 1992 was around $12,000, and in 1995 roughly 23.4 percent of the county's population lived below the poverty level. Comparatively, 20.2 percent of Mississippians lived below the poverty level that same year. Surrounded by other small, rural towns, Holly Springs, with its population of approximately 12,000, seemed to be in a downward spiral. Benton County, the eastern neighbor of Marshall, had an even more dismal outlook, partly due to the presence of a national forest and its impact on tax revenues. However, with three new plant openings in the past two years, the unemployment rate in Marshall County has dropped to 4.6 percent and Benton County to 4.8 percent.

Abstract: The entrepreneurship education program is a tool that is preparing students with disabilities for the real world. The students in the program identify their interest through a process known as Person Center Planning. They identify how/where work is best performed, and support needs that may be necessary for them when working. This requires the teacher and support people to spend time doing things with the students that are typical. Support people are mentors from the regular classroom.

The mentors come into the classroom to help tutor the students, to teach socialization skills or other activities. Good discovery results in identifying and clarifying just why the student wishes to embark on owning and establishing his or her own business. In addition to learning how to set up a business, the students have learned how to manage money, banking skills, how to do paperwork, and reading skills have been incorporated into the program.

Some of the businesses started by students in the program include:

Soapy Gator Car Wash is owned by a student. The business is an auto detailing business that serves faculty and the community.
First Class Laundry washes, dries, folds, and irons clothes for the neighboring schools and the community.
Katherine's Coffee Cart is located on the campus of a local university. The coffee cart serves a variety of cookies and coffee for college students and faculty. There also has been collaboration with agencies such as Vocational Rehabilitation, family, peers, and the community in making the owner's dreams become reality.
Gator Goodies is a project that promotes interest in the careers of baking, customer aservice and satisfaction as well as business management.
Gator Gift Shop makes gift cards and balloon bouquets for special occasions.
The program has provided a career opportunity for students who may never go to college. The entrepreneurial experience has been a way to upgrade the students' abilities to success as an employee as well as an entrepreneur. The program has also provided experience for the students to see new opportunities for their lives. The entrepreneur experience has empowered students with disabilities to become self-sufficient, independent, income-producing citizens of our community."

Abstract: The Mississippi State University Extension Service (MSU-ES) is addressing the needs of small businesses through the Virtual Entrepreneurial Education & Training Project. The Project is funded jointly by the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and MSU-ES. The project has both adult and youth entrepreneurial components targeting entrepreneurs in ARC counties with an emphasis on business and e-commerce skill development. Several new economic development programs have been developed and implemented as a result of this joint effort.

Adult Entrepreneurial Training 
An Entrepreneurship 101 course consisting of a series of four workshops was developed and implemented; the workshops include Basic Business Start-Up, Marketing Products & Services, Small Business Recordkeeping & Taxes, and Writing a Business Plan. The target audience is new and existing business owners.

A one-day ""Electronic Retailing: Selling on the Internet"" conference was developed for existing and new business start-ups that want to sell products and services to customers through a retail web site. The first conference was held at the Bost Conference Center located on the Mississippi State University main campus at Starkville, Mississippi and transmitted live through interactive video to five locations in the state (Cleveland, Jackson, Meridian, Summit, and Verona). Ninety-five people attended the conference. Two-thirds of the attendees represented businesses, one-sixth represented chambers of commerce and other government agencies, and one-sixth represented educators.

An in-depth specialized e-commerce training course, E-BIZ, for small businesses was developed and piloted in Spring 2001. The curriculum consists of four hands-on workshops as follows: Small Business E-Commerce Overview and Site Analysis, Web Store Development I, Web Store Development II, and Web Site Marketing.

As part of the project a case study was conducted. Participating in the case study was a single mother, minority entrepreneur who was on public assistance. She has grown her children's accessory business over the past 10 years and it has become quite profitable. She had been trying to establish an e-commerce site for her business for over two years and had not been successful in doing so until she became part of the ARC project. Through intensive one-on-one training, the project took her through the entire process of setting up her own electronic store on the Internet (www.cjsbows.com).

Abstract: During the summer of 2001, a three-week workshop was offered to seven teams of middle school students and teachers from Choctaw, Clay, Oktibbeha and Leflore counties in Mississippi. A total of seven teachers and eighteen students participated in the Regional Youth Entrepreneurship for Career and Research Exploration for Students and Teachers (CREST) workshop.

During the workshop instruction was given in establishing and developing the multimedia business. The participants learned how to design a plan of action and a business plan; to select a company name and a logo; to analyze the market to estimate the product's potential; to design the product; to develop a marketing strategy and an advertisement strategy; to address operational concerns such as location, facilities, equipment and production procedures; and, to consider personnel issues. They also learned about the financial stages of establishing a company: seed money; start-up money; and money for financial growth.

The participants were given the charge of establishing a company whose mission it is to design and produce multimedia materials that illustrate mine and power plant operations and economics. The participants selected six company divisions: the mining process; the Red Hills Mine; air quality; water quality; economic development, and wildlife and reclamation. Both company and divisional staff meetings were held to discuss the method and procedure for working on the multimedia materials and presentations. The student/teacher teams used a variety of technological tools such as PowerPoint, i-Movies, and Microsoft Word to design flyers, games, flash cards, presentations and movies to describe what they had learned and observed through lectures, tours, and hands-on activities.

Each company division selected a company name and designed a logo illustrating the company product. At a company meeting, a representative from each division presented their design and company name and the company name selected was IMPACT. IMPACT is an acronym for Impact of Mining on People and Community Today. IMPACT was chosen because the participants believed that the logo and name informed the citizens of Choctaw County and the surrounding communities of Red Hills Mine's impact on the community. Red Hills Mine affects the people, schools, economic development, local businesses and employment opportunities in Choctaw County and the surrounding environs."

Abstract: Seventh and eighth grade students and teachers at Tupelo Middle School are using the Excel Technology SELECT program (Excel Tech), in combination with Junior Achievement's Enterprise in Action program, to help students develop advanced technology skills and then apply these skills in a number of entrepreneurial ways. Through Junior Achievement's Enterprise in Action program, and the use interactive business simulation software to model real world business experiences, students develop business skills and tools to create student-run enterprises.

Using their advanced tech skills, students perform many advanced technology duties for teachers, including computer installation, repair, setup, troubleshooting, and even training. Students also perform Internet searches, create PowerPoint presentations, program brochures, and flyers. In addition to ""helping out"", the students have also created a business venture-a video yearbook that will be sold to the student body. The students are even marketing the video yearbook through a ""commercial"" that they created, which will be aired via television broadcasts in the school.

The students are also creating a school web site. In order to finance the web site project, the students created a calendar making business, using their knowledge of Microsoft Publisher They now provide personalized calendars for a $10 fee, scanning photos, importing them into software, printing and binding them, and managing the daily revenue. With the revenue, they have voted to hire a professional Microsoft FrontPage trainer from a local Internet service provider to help train them in web site development.

In addition to profit-making enterprises, the students also participate in community projects that are entrepreneurial in nature. The school purchased 20 laptops that were used by residents of a retirement community, with the Excel Tech students installing software and becoming tutors for the elderly population. In addition, the students purchased computer parts, assembled them into computers, and donated them to a local elementary school.

Site visits to high technology companies give students glimpses into the bigger world of entrepreneurship. They see how supply and demand works, learn about customer and business relations, and see the link between what they learn and technology used in private businesses. The students have an opportunity to apply what they've learned, to 'put it to the test.' In other courses, for example, you may study foreign languages, but you may not have a chance to go that country. Our program takes classroom learning and combines it with real application. By helping adults understand the technology, the students gain more self-confidence, which I believe carries over into their other classes.

Due to the success of the Excel Tech program, the local school board adopted it in the school curriculum and will continue to fund the salary of the program teacher. The program is being used as a model throughout the state of Mississippi; middle and high school representatives have visited the school from all over the state wishing to replicate the program. The program has also been highlighted at local and regional education conferences."

Abstract: In the Entrepreneurship course, students developed business/career skills and were able to apply them to a real-life situation. Students worked with the Albion City Council, the Albion Development Company, and many community leaders. Students were recognized by the Albion Chamber of Commerce with the Youth Involvement Award at the 2002 Presidential Banquet. Students also presented at the UNO Social Studies Conference and were participants in a rural economic forum on NETV.

Students kept track of over $52,000 in contributions from over 250 donors. Students also kept an automated checkbook to record payments of expenses for the project. The entrepreneurship class formed a non-profit 509(a)(3) organization named the Gateway Youth Foundation. The Foundation purchased the theater on January 18, 2002, for $35,000. After purchasing the theater, the group had monthly water, gas, electricity, and sanitation bills to pay. Many expenses were incurred during the renovation process, which had to be accounted for and paid.

Computers were used to create a database of alumni from Albion High School. Over 2,000 postcards sent to alumni seeking donations to the project. Utilizing the mail merge capabilities of the software, financial statements were sent to donors of over $250 at the end of 2001. The computers were also used to create PowerPoint presentations, which were presented throughout the year at many community organizations. Thank you notes were created, as well as various posters, digital images, etc.

Students will be managing the business in the upcoming school year. They will be in charge of managing the theater, organizing volunteers to operate the concession stand and the ticket booth, to create all advertising, maintenance of the building, selection of movies, etc."

Abstract: The students served in this program are students who need skills to survive in a small town with a lot to offer travelers and vacationers. This is a great location for these students to set up a thriving business of their own when they graduate from school. The students businesses would help the community grow and thrive.

The program is designed to help students reach their fullest potential through class instruction and hands-on training. This is a new program for this school. During class instruction students become aware of their skills and what their skills can do for them, and their community. The students are also able to look at different areas where they could put their skills to work. When the students are involved in the hands-on training, they are developing knowledge of the actual work, safety practices, the decision-making process, and the responsibilities that are involved.

The unique feature of this program is that students are strongly encouraged to be entrepreneurs. The students develop promising ideas of an entrepreneurial business and research what is needed to get their business up and running. Eventually, the class will be able to set up their own business as a class project to help enhance the ability for them to start their own business."
NE,THE HOME SCHOOL COMMUNITY,www.omahapiano.com,"Abstract:

Entrepreneurship Educators will be introduced to the home schooling community through home school co-ops, state conventions, and networks throughout the country. With over two million Home Schoolers in the US, how can an Entrepreneurship Educator tap this growing market? Is there a ""key"" to unlocking the door to this massive subculture? Working with home school families requires a different setting, mindset and projects.

The Home Schooling Community is well-connected; a huge subculture with quality families and students. Entrepreneurship classes were taught in a local Home School Learning Center and entrepreneurship presentations were given at three State Home School Conventions.

Nebraska's 4-H ESI curriculum was used in teaching entrepreneurship classes at the Omaha Home School Learning Center. During the semester, three local colleges collaborated with the budding entrepreneurs for educational exchanges and at the end of the semester, an Entrepreneurship Expo was held with college entrepreneurship students judging the home schoolers' presentations and displays and awarding the top students. Entrepreneurship presentations were given at three State Home School Conventions which connected home school families with the entrepreneurial mindset with the ESI curriculum.

Abstract: NebraskaEDGE is an umbrella organization for entrepreneurial training programs that are held in partnership with local communities, organizations and associations. For the last 15 years, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's NebraskaEDGE program has helped nearly 2,500 individuals, small business owners and their partners start and improve their businesses. Comprehensive educational courses are provided to increase management skills that lead to new, expanding and profitable businesses, increased personal wealth, improved community business networks and an expanded community economic base. Training courses have been held in large and small, urban and rural communities across Nebraska.

Technology and competition are driving forces that are changing the way we provide and deliver entrepreneurship education. We have seen an increase in the variety of curricula, methods of delivery and online resources for technical assistance. We have also seen an increase in required reports for greater accountability. As a program that has been around for 15 years, these changes have greatly impacted how we conduct business and have forced us to re-evaluate and strategically plan how and what we are going to do in the future.

In March 2008 we pulled together stakeholders to learn what they perceived to be our strengths, gathered information on community/industry changes and set directions for future development. Next we set out to measure current outcomes and interest in our future directions. To capture data, we developed two surveys, one to measure personal growth, implementation of business practices, and the other to measure business changes and results. We used the Don Dillon Survey Methodology to achieve nearly 40% response rates for both surveys.

As educators, we are asked to provide impacts of our efforts. These impacts are shared with administrators, politicians and funders. No longer is counting heads or completion rates sufficient to measure the effectiveness of a training effort. With careful planning, you can gather information to thoroughly evaluate training efforts."

Abstract: We serve community college students in both credit and not for credit courses in Entrepreneurship Education. We have a very diverse student population, including a steady increase in Asian students and Sudanese students, especially in Business Administration. We are also seeing an increase in Baby Boomers in the entrepreneurship courses, as many of these students are looking for information on either how to become an entrepreneur, or how to take their entrepreneurial dream to the next level.

At Southeast Community College we have an AAS degree and a Certificate in Entrepreneurship through our Business Administration Program. We also have the Business Development Academy Certificate offered through our Continuing Education Program. We have a comprehensive Entrepreneurship Center that is a resource to anyone within the state of Nebraska who needs help starting a new venture. The Center houses the Entrepreneurship staff offices, classrooms, resource organizations such as SCORE, Nebraska Business Development Center-Procurement Division, Community Development Resources and Junior Achievement, a business incubator which houses 12 new start-up businesses, a high school student business incubator which houses 2 student businesses and the Entrepreneurship Focus High School Program.

The Southeast Community College Entrepreneurship Center has several unique features. First, we work closely with the SCC Continuing Education Center. This allows up to cross-use facilities and we have the ability to partner on many different entrepreneurially focused projects. Second, we feature a High School designed for students interested in an education geared specifically to entrepreneur minded youth. This Entrepreneurship Focus Program (EFP) was developed by Lincoln Public Schools, in conjunction with the college, to offer students an opportunity to explore entrepreneurship to the fullest extent at an early age. The program incorporates entrepreneurship into their general studies in the areas of Math, English, Social Studies and Business. Third, the Center works with a variety of divisions within the college to offer entrepreneurship courses for any student even remotely thinking they might start a business of their own one day. Working with programs such as Early Childhood Development, Agriculture, Business and Food Services, we have expanded our student base to encompass more potential entrepreneurs. Finally, SCC was instrumental in developing a state wide initiative in Entrepreneurship Education that has become a model for other institutions and states to follow.

Over the past 6 years more Generation X students are choosing to start their own businesses both during and after college. They do not perceive launching a business as a risky career path and account for approximately 70% of all new business startups (Bagby, 1998; Phillips, 1999). Students who are interested in creating new businesses need to develop an array of skills that will support their new venture. These skills are not restricted to business related topics. They need to know how Math, English, Science and other subjects relate to their entrepreneurial venture. When educated properly the result will be cutting-edge students who are empowered to be innovative either as entrepreneurs creating and growing new companies or intrapreneurs working within established companies and organizations.

Very few faculty members have attempted to integrate entrepreneurial examples into their program courses. Our goal is to provide information to those interested in integrating entrepreneurship education and activities into their current classroom structure no matter the subject. We provide teaching examples applicable to several different programs of study as well as for general education courses such as Math, Science, English and Speech.

Tim Mittan M.A.M., is the Director of the Southeast Community College Entrepreneurship Center. He was instrumental in the creation of the Center and is dedicated to Educating, Enhancing, and Empowering Entrepreneurs. Some services at the Center include a business incubator, courses in entrepreneurship education and a high school focus program. He is also heavily involved in a statewide as well national effort to promote the Entrepreneurial Spirit. He serves on the 4 H Entrepreneurship Investigation Curriculum Board, is the Chair of the Nebraska Entrepreneurship Task Force and is active with the National Association of Community College Entrepreneurship.

The College includes three campuses and more than 20 off-campus sites in 15 counties. Each location offers individual benefits; from rural friendliness and small city energy to metropolitan ambience. In addition to our campus locations, SCC serves 15 counties located in southeast Nebraska with courses operated through the College Continuing Education division. Southeast Community College values the opportunity to provide quality career/technical and academic educational opportunities for the students, businesses and communities of our district."
NE,University of Nebraska-Lincoln - Extension,http://4hcurriculum.edu/index.html,"Abstract: Nebraska 4-H has developed a holistic, competency-based entrepreneurship curricula designed for youth ages 10 - 19 to be used by clubs, camps, schools and community organizations. It has the enthusiastic support and involvement of the Nebraska Department of Education and is aligned to school standards. The overarching goals are for youth to think like an entrepreneur at a very young age and to help youth understand that they can control where they want to live by being their own employer.

Unit 1: Discover the E-Scene is designed for youth to learn what it means to be an entrepreneur;
Unit 2: The Case of Me is designed to develop basic skills needed to succeed in the professional and business world.
Unit 3: Your Business Inspection is designed for youth to actually learn what is required to start a business. It features concept development, resourcing and start-up. Developing a business plan is a key component.
ESI was developed with four audiences in mind: 4-H clubs, middle school and high school classes and youth organizations (it is aligned to school standards), extension community resource development educators and local community economic development organizations/agencies.

Perhaps the most unique feature is that the curriculum is community friendly. Care is given for youth to explore and involve their own community in search of its history, culture and opportunities. Technology is treated as a tool and resource. A CDROM provides enrichment activities and a web site contains appropriate links.

ESI was piloted by approximately 400 youth in 28 sites in Nebraska. It is competency-based, utilizes the experiential learning model, and is highly flexible. The evaluations of the variety of modalities and methodologies have been excellent. It has been piloted in clubs, camps, middle schools, high schools, home schools and adults ages 10 - adult.

The Mission of the Entrepreneurship program is to prepare all students to be productive citizens and excellent communicators in a global society by providing essential business and communication experiences, education and technology skills in a dynamic, real business, and learning environment.

The class helps students understand businesses and what it takes to be successful, develop problem solving skills, and pride in workmanship. These are all traits that local businesses need from their employees.

All of the students are Native Americans so traditional crafts are encouraged, taught and incorporated into their projects. Students have enhanced clothing that staff received at Christmas from the school. They take great pride in the recognition they receive for their work. They recognize the importance of quality work when they see the teachers, administration, and paraprofessionals wearing the shirt they embroidered.

Students have opportunities to make hats that are given to a local charity for community members. The students developed an understanding of cost of production and market value. They experienced the reality that sometimes it is not profitable to produce an item."

Geographic Area: Nevada

Abstract: The business plan and business plan presentations are key tools, used in advancing the spirit of entrepreneurship in the public education arena, the collegiate environment and by practicing entrepreneurs. We use a teaching-learning and training technique applied in high school, community college, undergraduate and graduate courses for business administration majors, entrepreneurial majors and for liberal arts undergraduates with interests in entrepreneurship. As a modified version of the ""one pager"" new venture summary plan submitted by entrepreneurs to angel investors and at venture capital funding source presentations, this technique shows students and their trainers how to answer five critical questions asked of all new ventures: What are you building? Why does this business exist? How will you build the business? What is the work to be done? What results will you measure?

The OPBP is a very simple, versatile, consistent, flexible tool and can be used for a variety of purposes. There is no room for fluff or filler. The use of key words and short phrases tells the reader or audience that only the essence is being presented for review. The fact that the business model is only one page communicates that the investment in reading and listening is limited. The OPBP can be used by students to develop a plan for a small company, or as a summarization of a traditional business plan. The OPBP purposes extend to profit centers, departments, program or projects. As a document that summarizes the ideas for a new business, the OPBP is also a presentation tool or a personal or professional planning device.

At Sierra Nevada College, we have adopted this technique in entrepreneurship courses taught across the curriculum to liberal arts students. This past fall a team of eight students and the professor conducted a workshop at the Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organization Conference (CEO) to a standing room only crowd. At the 2003 USASBE Annual Conference, Peter H. Hackbert won the ""best teaching practices award"" completing with against eight other entrepreneurial educators demonstrating this technique."

Social Entrepreneurship:An Introduction

There is growing awareness and interest among many non-profit organizations (NPO) in entrepreneurship. This interest can generally be placed in two spheres: 1) business activity by non-profits, and 2) entrepreneurial leadership of non-profits organizations.

Although business activity by non-profits might seem like a contradiction of purposes, there are many non-profits with decades of business experience in service to their social mission. Examples include the Girl Scouts (cookies), art museums (gift shops), and membership organizations (National Geographic). Other non-profits provide business services, including public television stations (production and post-production facilities) and health organizations (drug and alcohol counseling). Other examples of business activity conducted by non-profits include investments (real estate, stocks) and licensing (trademarks).

The influence of venture philanthropy has helped to increase interest in the management of non-profits. First, there has been significant growth in the number of startup non-profits during the last ten years, and like the for-profit startup sector, NPO startups depend significantly on the execution capabilities of its founders and initial management. Second, as venture philanthropists consider philanthropic investments (or gifts) in established non-profits, there is an awareness that human capital is one of the most serious capacity-building needs in these NPOs. Finally, some non-profits address large, complex and sophisticated issues (e.g., public school reform). Individuals with entrepreneurial training and experience - who, in effect, know how to act without having all of the necessary resources under their control -- bring significant assets to these challenging initiatives.

The Dartmouth Entrepreneurial Network, in conjunction with the Office of Venture Initiatives, is committed to encouraging social entrepreneurship in the Dartmouth community. As part of these efforts, Dartmouth alumni with entrepreneurial experience in non-profits have agreed to mentor and provide support to members of the Dartmouth community with interests in this arena."

Abstract: In the Albuquerque public schools there are several truly exemplary entrepreneurial programs associated with the DECA Vocational Student Organizations. Additionally, the School-to-Careers Department has greatly advanced the causes of work-based experiences in a school setting, and academic subjects taught in the context of work. What has been noted is that these entrepreneurial programs and academic studies are not integrated. In fact, the integration of these subjects is rare throughout the country.

Therefore, in 1998–1999 it was established that an entrepreneurship program in Albuquerque public schools will serve as both pilot and model for this implementation. The Applied Academic classes, which teach the skills needed to succeed in work, postsecondary school, and life; the school-based Occupational Education teaching in the area of Entrepreneurship; and the Entrepreneurial DECA VSO activities, which offer on-the-job training experiences, will be planned for implementation in 1999–2000. The combination of these three areas would result in an innovative program rarely available in the nation.

Such a program would effectively demonstrate the achievement of School-to-Work goals through a truly comprehensive system of education. It would support many of the state and national goals, especially the New Mexico State Board of Education's adoption of the defined Career Readiness skills. This integrated entrepreneurship program will meet established competencies, discuss delivery systems, share these within the district, and establish new agreements with post-secondary schools from around the state.

This program demonstrates the concepts and benefits of integrated academic and occupational education; what an integrated entrepreneurship program might look like; and what some of the problems/roadblocks that the initiative has encountered are. It also demonstrates the vision that this initiative will build on leadership skills of VSO participants and re-defines academic strategies, and achieves both without ""re-inventing the wheel."""
NM,Animas High School,www.mailman.animas.k12.nm.us,"Focus: Integration of entrepreneurship in a high school social studies course

Abstract: Students in history, law, government and economics create a business plan for a business they dream up, checking out financing, location, etc. Some have even created business cards, brochures, and menus depending on the type of business they want to start. Area business people, sole proprietors and partnerships, come in to toak to studentas. Students do personal budgets as well as budget simulations for families.

Students like the hands on approach, limited only by their own creativity. It encourages them to take risks and to eventually weigh the advantages and disadvantages of owning your own business in the pursuit of the American Dream."

Abstract: The Campus Café is a part of the Bernalillo High School Career Academy. The program began in 1994 with ten students enrolled in an advanced food service course. The program currently serves 110 students or more per year. The students at Bernalillo have designed a café that operates for breakfast and lunch and serves students and faculty. Their primary source of income is from the catering portion of their program. They cater to the school and community for a variety of events. Catered events have ranged from lunch for 20 adults to the district back-to-school event for 500 people.

The business began as a ""typical"" Home Economics Foods classroom. As the Bernalillo School-to-Work program began to change the way it does business, so did this program. Spankie Lou Bassett and the students designed the business after completing market research and working with the school community. The philosophy statement: the Campus Café is open to provide a variety of foods to students and staff at Bernalillo High School. The café will also provide the following learning experiences for student personnel:

Work experience in the food-service area
Team-building skills
Cooperation and responsibility
Respect
Money management
Customer service
Fun!
When the students and Mrs. Bassett were given the opportunity to update their ""avocado green"" kitchens to a new Culinary Arts program, they traveled the state looking at vocational schools and restaurants. Their new facility is a change in the way high school career and technical courses are taught. They have a lab, café, computer lab, and professional cooking equipment to help their business succeed and give them the professional skills needed to compete in the culinary world. The curriculum has expanded to include Food Service I, Food Service II, Catering, and Professional Baking. In the spring of 1999, the students also opened the Campus Bakery, offering fresh-baked goods once a week to the community."

Abstract: Students served are Hispanic, Anglo, Native American, economically and academically handicapped, and/or those who really want to own their own businesses. Implementation of a school-based business in the entrepreneurship class provides practical ""real-world"" experience for students. The class will produce a CD-ROM Multimedia Yearbook for sale to other students and interested community members during the 1999–2000 school year. Other classes (Computer Graphics, Computer Accounting, and Leadership) are aiding with the project. An expansion of the project to include community events, weddings, or other activities and the duplicatation and sale of the CDs is also being considered.

From researching companies on the internet, students have already begun to learn the value of the commercial information available for their business plans. Surveys prepared, distributed, and retrieved by the students are providing data for analysis in advertising, pricing, and timeline decision making.

Students are divided into departments, with a management team leading each 9-week period. Students are the production team as well as the sales force and the accounting department. They must take pictures and videos to integrate them into an organized multimedia publication. They write the copy for each page and choose the layouts. All forms, from receipts to surveys, must be designed by the student. Each student keeps his/her own separate business plan along with the class business plan.

The risk of business ownership, management of employee (other students), and communication skills are all presented to students through the CD Yearbook. Also, legal and ethical considerations must be set. The excitement has grown steadily since the first day of school. Problems have arisen and been faced with solutions generated by the students.

The regular yearbook staff has been concerned about the effect the CD Yearbook will have on their sales. According to our surveys, most students will opt to purchase both or just the regular yearbook. A sense of sympathetic cooperation is developing toward the regular yearbook staff. CD-ROM yearbook staff are accepting a ""soft-sell"" approach in order to not alienate any potential customers."

High school students are trained to think like entrepreneurs; they write their own business plans and apply for small business loans from our 501c3 - Employers to Educators. Upon acceptance of the loan, students start up their small businesses. Students are matched with mentors from the business community and also meet with the after-school class to discuss and reflect on their experiences in the world of small business.

Upon completion of the loan cycle, students may either repay their loan with interest or repay the loan by helping teach middle-schoolers about entrepreneurship. The middle-schoolers will then replicate the program and also have the opportunity to repay their loans by working with elementary students to teach them about entrepreneurship. Participants are self-selected students who express an interest in owning their own businesses."

Abstract: In a course called Exploring Careers, we teach students each semester about the workplace. They are required to start a business. They make products using simple items. The products must work and they must be able to determine costs. Students build the product or create a prototype. Students are then taught the process of developing a business plan, a budget, and a work-related manual.

Students are then required to present their product through a commercial using PowerPoint, videotape, and/or performing it. Students are required to post a job opening, interview others for the job opening, hold meetings, keep notes, create a logo, mission statement and demonstrate work ethics. Students must make a final presentation to the teacher and volunteers about what the experience has taught them.

Some of the unique features of the program are that it can all be done in class and students use their own creativity to come up with products. Students with disabilities can be included. The students have taken what they have done in class and started a small business. Students have also expressed through evaluation how they learned about teamwork, dealing with conflict and how hard it is to run a business. Students have also expressed the difficulty in finding good workers. Students also were able to see the interrelationship the core subjects have in the workplace, through activities on product development, marketing strategies, and cost analysis."

Abstract: Statistically, youth from the state of New Mexico are consistently ranked higher in relationship to children living in poverty, and other negative deficits. This then is obviously magnified in the tri-county area which we serve, which , because of these ""deficits"" has been federally designated as an enterprise community.

La Jicarita Enterprise Community, as a whole, is ""set up"" for socio-economic development and has 26 current, active ""initiatives"" of which youth development, encompasses three. One of the core areas in youth development is our entrepreneur program. We, as an organization, recognize that a formalized four year education is not for everyone, and that many of our students, upon high school graduation, will continue to reside in their respective communities. Geographically, two of three sites, are isolated in nature, with sole access by mountain pass.

For centuries, our community members have financially sustained themselves and their family members by being entrepreneurs. Conversely, then many of our youth will also continue to be entrepreneurs. During the summer we provide for those students from the enterprise community, an intensive week long, entrepreneur, leadership training camp. As an inkind contribution, each school district, in which we reside, provides a classroom for our staff, so that students have access to the LJEC counselor and vice-versa. During the regular school year, we provide via our entrepreneur counselors, ongoing support, training, and technical assistance for our young entrepreneurs. We use a medium of materials and curriculums, for example, BizWorld and KidsWay.

We have received national, state, and regional recognition for our work with student entrepreneurs. Our students have also received national, state, and regional recognition for their business endeavors.

Abstract: SPINS was a summer camp program for Navajo youth that ran continuously from 1987 to 1993, alternating between three universities in Arizona and New Mexico as host sites. The camp consisted of workshops in introductory accounting, management, finance, marketing, and business plan development, and visits to Native American–owned and operated businesses in the region.

SPINS was founded by the Navajo Nation and nearby business schools in an effort to provide entrepreneurial training to talented Navajo youth the summer before they entered college. The program was initiated by the Navajo Nation when they realized that students who earned professional degrees were rarely able to return to the reservation because there were few employment opportunities in their specialized fields. The objective of the program was to encourage students to bring their expertise back to their community and to start new businesses to benefit Navajo communities."

Abstract: Reaching High is a company built with a hands-on approach that meets state standards across the curriculum. It incorporates entrepreneurship with your existing studies as it builds self esteem and inspires creativity and ambition. The program involves the students in decision making as they experience the facets of owning and managing a small business. The students learn responsibility as they develop good communication skills, make sound business decisions, and become involved in a team approach to the world of work.

The students learn the meaning of the vocabulary used in business in a concrete, hands-on experience. They obtain seed money, take a product and market it, and become risk takers as they strive for a profit. This program is focused on turning fundraisers into entrepreneurship endeavors, teaching money in the classroom using real business practices, and directing a school store involving students from interviewing to hiring to receiving a real pay check. Reaching High involves elementary students in the rewards of hard work. The basic components can very easily be modified and applied to any level of instruction.

The owners have directed a school-based business with their students known as Budding Entrepreneurs. This business incorporated manufacturing, wholesale, and retail sales. They invested in the stock market to initiate an interest in how you can earn money in the stock market. They owned and operated a school store, hiring workers from the school community and became involved in being an entrepreneur.

Linda, Marie, and Clo each taught for 33 years, and recently retired. During their tenure, they won a 1st place award in 1973 from the New Mexico Research and Study Council for Budding Entrepreneurs.

Entrepreneurship for Special Populations",none listed,"Focus: Art-based vocational training program that encourages choice making and self-determination.

Geographic Area: Albuquerque Public Schools, the 27th-largest school district in America, serving a student population of over 50,000.

Age Level: High school students age 14 to 22 years with cognitive functioning in the 18-months-to-4-year-old range. Students are classified as multiply impaired with an IQ range of under 40. In addition to having intellectual disabilities, the students also have combinations of other disabilities, including microcephaly, seizure disorders, autism, cerebral palsy, and orthopedic and neurological impairments.

Key Partners: The program is funded by the public school system and IDEA funds. Private, for-profit businesses and service clubs are key partners that support the program through donations of gifts in-kind, equipment, money, and venues for displaying and selling the products. The local Civitan clubs lend great support and often organize donation procedures. The Weems Gallery and Framing Company donates booth space at its gallery and also at its annual ArtFest, a nationally juried art show.

Abstract: The premise of the program is that everyone can be productive when given the opportunity and support. It is vitally important that individuals be allowed to self-determine and choose their vocation. Art-based activities lead to self-determination by providing opportunities for participants to (1) express creativity, (2) communicate, (3) choose activities and degree of participation, and (4) succeed at their given task. Many individuals with multiple impairments often do not have opportunities for expression and communication. These persons may stop trying to communicate because non-disabled staff, peers, and caregivers lack time or desire to listen or interact. An art-based program is rich in avenues for exploring creativity, self-discovery, and communication.

The students in this program are non-traditional in the scope of a vocational education program because of their level of cognitive functioning and their need for support. With environmental modifications and other such support, these students can be highly successful after graduation by being placed in a sheltered setting or an enclave situation (a group of two or more workers performing a particular job).

Even the most severely impaired students can achieve success in this program. A student who has been blind from birth can successfully complete a project. First, she chooses which art activity she wants to do by using a tactile symbol board; i.e., the symbol for collage is a piece of burlap and fibers. Then she can make a color choice using tactile symbols; i.e., a lid to a jar represents blue-it is a smooth, cool color. Fibers, beads, paper scraps, and other pieces are already color-sorted into boxes, so that each project will have a ""flow."" The student then selects pieces from the box. The work surface is raised about three inches off the work table, and the base of the collage is placed on this work surface. The student applies glue to the entire base of the collage, and then, with the assistance of a sighted staff person, places the items on the collage base. When the piece is finished, it is matted and framed.

Group projects stimulate communication and interaction. Students participate in making homemade recycled paper that a local nonprofit group uses for stationery. The project is broken into several tasks: shredding paper, measuring shredded paper and water, turning on the blender, sifting pulp, and so on until the project is completed. The group process allows each student to be successful at whatever task has been chosen. Team building, learning to take turns, cooperation, and communication are skills learned in the context of the art project.

Resulting Product: Matted and framed paintings, collages, pottery, jewelry, candles, and stationery are ready for sale through art shows, galleries, and a student-run craft bazaar on campus. Students in the program gain career-readiness skills for post-high school job placements by learning task analysis, choice making, team building, job completion, attention to task, and pride in achievements."

Abstract: The Urban Entrepreneurial Training Program is a component of the Canisius College's Urban Community Service Program (UCSP) funded by the United States Department of Education. UCSP is an applied research initiative that involves conducting an empirical study of economic and entrepreneurial activity of small urban businesses in the Ellicott, Masten, and University districts of the city of Buffalo, New York. UCSP is a three-year initiative with overarching goals: (1) develop a comprehensive database of business and economic activity in the target area, (2) provide entrepreneurial training to select urban businesses/entrepreneurs, and (3) provide a framework for policy makers and economic development organizations to strengthen their assistance and support of small urban businesses and urban entrepreneurs.

The Urban Entrepreneurial Training Program (UETP), a 12-week program, is designed to work with a select group of small businesses, providing them with in-depth information to increase their productivity. The program is developed around four key components: (1) program modules, (2) business roundtables, (3) access to professional business consultants and (4) a mentor initiative.

The aim of the training program is to increase the productivity, profitability, and employment potential of small urban businesses participating in UETP by providing entrepreneurs with tools and techniques to help them (1) identify, locate, and evaluate business information; (2) develop creative problem-solving skills; (3) develop methods to deal with fear and ambiguity in a business environment; (4) develop communication and interpersonal skills; and (5) assess their skill level and ability to pursue entrepreneurial initiatives."

The Ceramics Corridor is built on the presence in the Southern Tier of the State University of New York College of Ceramics at Alfred University, Corning Inc., Alfred Technology Resources, Inc. (ATRI), and a cluster of firms operating in the geographic region.

This ARC entrepreneurship project has the following components:

Development of an industry-driven, participatory industry trade association for the Southern Tier West region
Through support to existing and new cluster businesses, the trade association will promote the development of the cluster, and the development of entrepreneurial opportunities therein. The trade association will function to provide networking, support, and communication between member firms.

Assistance to specific components of the ATRI marketing initiative
The ATRI marketing initiative will improve the success of the Ceramics Corridor Innovation Center (cluster-specific small business incubator) program, ultimately leading to additional entrepreneurship in the Southern Tier West region in the ceramics cluster. Project assistance includes support for Web page design ( http://www.infoblvd.net/corridor/), marketing video production, editorial content for print advertising, and brochure development.

Start-up of a Venture Development Corporation
The objectives of this component are the development of an umbrella nonprofit Venture Development Corporation that owns and operates a number of subsidiary venture corporations. The Venture Development Corporation obtains advanced technologies through licenses, commercializes these technologies through the development of actual subsidiary venture companies, and then spins these venture companies off to the private sector. The ownership structure of the young venture corporations varies with each technology and the individual ""deal."" For example, the individual young venture corporations can be wholly owned by the umbrella Venture Development Corporation, joint ventures between the Venture Development Corporation and firms in the ceramics industry, joint ventures between the Venture Development Corporation and venture capitalists or venture capital funds, joint ventures between the Venture Development Corporation and individual entrepreneurs, etc. Thus, the program can be seen as offering additional opportunities for entrepreneurs to become involved in this cluster.

Assistance to the Alfred University internship program
This component is an internship program at the College of Ceramics and the College of Business at Alfred University targeting the Southern Tier West region ceramics cluster firms. The project is intended to lead to local employment opportunities for participating interns, but perhaps more importantly, to show interns that there are in fact entrepreneurial opportunities in the cluster in the Southern Tier West region.

Assistance to cluster businesses with respect to productivity enhancement
This component subsidizes the participating cluster firm's share of accessing productivity consultants for the purpose of enhancing productivity. Higher productivity means competitiveness, and as such this component is an economic development program. Consulting services are provided through the Western New York Technology Development Corporation. This component also will reinforce the region's cluster entrepreneurs by providing access to skill sets that they otherwise might not have in-house.

Note: The Southern Tier West region is part of the rural Appalachian Region, located in the southwestern corner of New York State. Thus, the project can be seen as a project to promote high-technology entrepreneurship in a rural environment. The project involves partnerships between the public-sector economic development community, the private-sector business community, and the university community."

The program is the result of the instructor's experience with the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship. The program is a four-tier approach:

Tier 1: an exploration into business, economics, and finance via a 1–2 week workshop
Tier 2: students log onto our entrepreneurship Web site to further their knowledge in the world of business
Tier 3: students choose from the following:stay within the Career Services Program and be just an active member; further career goals by putting together a career plan; work to create a business plan for their individual business concept
Tier 4: After completing their business plans and presenting them in front of a venture capital board, they choose to continue in one of the following:furthering individual business idea while working with an entrepreneurial consultant; working on a group business idea with fellow participants; completing a career plan to further career goals.
The four-tier approach is a unique program design. It has the benefits of linking students with entrepreneurs, business school professionals, and project staff on an individual basis to assist with their business and career plans. They have access to an entrepreneurial Web site for further instruction. Goldman Sachs is proud of their first Institute for Entrepreneurship as a nationally recognized program."

Abstract: This program, entitled ""Integrating Computer Technology with Entrepreneurship,"" is designed to demonstrate and reinforce the importance of computers to youth entrepreneurs in developing and enhancing their business.

We examine the steps that Andre Edwards, a self-proclaimed freelance artist, took to turn what was just a hobby into a profit-making business. His steps to entrepreneurial success almost always included the use of a computer and various types of software, and the software he used and what he used it for.

We demonstrate how a word processor was used to create the business plan;

how a spreadsheet was used to assist with the tracking of money earned and spent;
how a database application was used to organize customer information;
how a presentation was created to visually display products and services to potential clients;
how the Internet/online services were used to keep informed about the industry; and
how graphic-design and desktop-publishing software was used to create, enhance, and print graphic material.
Andre is a high school graduate who has begun his journey to entrepreneurial success as an artist who is looking to explore the area of graphic design. He has been a consultant for STC Computer Training and previously owned businesses of Troy Burgher's, providing such services as logo design, general artwork, and computer assistance. He is currently working as a data-entry operator, which allows him to improve his computer skills while gaining income to finance his entrepreneurial endeavors."

This is a 21-hour program, which we have presented each semester during the past two years. Attendance at the first four programs totaled 71 potential small-business owners. It is a highly interactive course, which introduces the basic concepts of business ownership in a group setting. The course is designed to increase the chances of success for participants. It introduces the elements of small-business ownership, provides how-to information, helps development of essential skills, and gives a realistic understanding of all that is involved in small-business ownership. Several of the participants in the course were existing small-business owners who found the program very useful in upgrading and refining their business skills.

Included in the program are interactive discussion and small-group activities relating to such topics as setting goals, developing mission statements, and what it takes to be an entrepreneur. Other topics include business start-up; management issues (including record keeping and cash flow); marketing and selling your product and service; ""people skills"" required by the business owner; and, finally, how to get started putting your business plan together."

Abstract: Founded in the early 1980s, REAL Enterprises' mission is to help individuals, schools, communities, and rural America grow through hands-on entrepreneurship education. REAL is committed to preparing youths and adults to be active, self-sufficient, and productive citizens and effective contributors to community and economic development by: creating and sustaining a national network of dynamic entrepreneurship educators supported by effective member organizations, providing high-quality hands-on entrepreneurship curriculum and training for K-16 educators; advocating for experiential education and entrepreneurship; and documenting REAL's effectiveness for students and teachers. REAL serves and supports schools and teachers through nonprofit national and member organizations throughout the United States, six of which serve states in the ARC service region.
How it Works: At the high school/post-secondary level, REAL guides students through the process of creating small businesses of their own design. The process includes:

self-assessment to determine students' potential and existing marketable strengths
community analysis to identify needs and trends in the local economy
researching/writing a comprehensive business plan for a student's chosen enterprise
start-up support for participants who choose to open and operate enterprises.
A community support team of entrepreneurs and others from the local community assists each local program. REAL has been successfully integrated into existing post-secondary degree/certificate programs and has demonstrated its ability to create successful businesses.

In elementary and middle schools, Mini/Middle REAL helps students explore entrepreneurship in the context of a fully functioning in-school community (with a ""Merchant's Mall,"" government, revenue, and court system), understand the economic implications of career and lifestyle choices, and apply entrepreneurial practices to school-based enterprises and community needs."

Products and Services: For a modest tuition fee, companies participating in NYS-START receive comprehensive and customized export marketing plans with detailed international market entry and expansion strategies, developed by graduate business student interns, with guidance from trade expert teams led by Empire State Development (ESD) international professionals. Participating firms may also apply for matching funds to implement qualified export projects resulting from export marketing plans. Matching funds will be available to firms subject to application and approval by ESD.

Key Partners: US Department of Commerce Export Assistance Centers in New York (part of their Rural Export Initiative), university faculty ( e.g. Alfred University, Cornell, and State University of New York schools at Alfred, Buffalo, Binghamton, and Fredonia), county Industrial Development Agencies, the Southern Tier West, East and Central Regional Planning and Development Boards, Small Business Development Centers and other business partners.

Abstract:   The New York State-Southern Tier Appalachian Rural Trade (NYS-START) project will provide qualified businesses in targeted ARC counties with valuable international trade assistance, customized export marketing plans and access to matching funds for actually implementing qualified export projects. The NYS-START initiative provides the framework for supporting entrepreneurs in expanding global business and regional job retention and creation.

While New York State is a leader in the global marketplace, the number of small and medium-sized company exporters from rural ARC counties is not representative of either state or national participation averages. Products and services produced by firms within Appalachian New York, though high quality, suffer from the lack of international market access. Geographic obstacles beyond the control of individual companies, such as higher transportation costs and distance from export services often clustered in urban areas, play a role in limiting global access for rural entrepreneurs. Another significant factor related to global market access difficulties a factor that is under companies' direct control relates to the failure of rural businesses to produce an effective international market entry strategy. It is hoped that businesses participating in NYS-START will gain the resources to compete effectively in the global marketplace, and will increase their exports and workforce in the ARC region of rural New York."
NY,"North Syracuse High School
Business Ownership/Entrepreneurship", www.nscsd.k12.ny.us,"Focus: Business Ownership/Entrepreneurship serves a heterogeneous group of approximately 90 students in grades 10-12.

Abstract: The Cicero-North Syracuse Business Department recognizes that due to the resurgence of small business in the United State, entrepreneurship has become an essential component of business curriculum. Our entrepreneurship program integrates entrepreneurship/business management principles and theory with ""real life"" experience in operating a business.

The Business Ownership course provides students with an opportunity to actually become entrepreneurs by starting a class business-a retail firm located within the school. The school provides us with a location designated specifically for the student-run business, which is separate from the actual school bookstore. Students structure the business as a partnership- developing a partnership agreement. They are involved in all aspects of business ownership, including: conducting market research, creating a name and logo, preparing a business plan, locating suppliers, purchasing and pricing inventory, developing new products, selling, advertising, bookkeeping, taxation, and preparing financial statements.

In addition to hands-on experience in operating the business, students use a variety of resources to learn business management principles, theory, and law. Business publications used to teach the course include: Inc, Entrepreneurship, Young Entrepreneur, and Black Enterprise. The textbooks used to teach the course include: How to Start. Run. and Stay in Business, Small-Time Operator, and Entrepreneurship, among others. Additionally, arrangements are made with local business owners to speak with students throughout the year.

The student-run business was created in 1999 with start-up capital I received from a School-to-Work mini-grant. The net profits earned each school year are given back to eligible students in the form of college textbook scholarships. Over the past three years, $3,000 in net profits has been awarded to students. As a result of this program, students learn firsthand the rewards and difficulties of operating a profitable business."

Abstract: This business plan development training has one clear purpose in mind—to have upon completion a completed business plan for rural ventures. The 20-hour program has been designed to incorporate less lectures and more hands-on activities. Students learn from analogies and from applying concepts right in the classroom.

Each class provides an opportunity to understand a segment of the business plan and learn how to apply the knowledge to rural activities. Among the elements incorporated to ""Checkmate"" are the critical challenges of marketing a business in rural areas and most important. Students learn how to market products and services internationally to give rural businesses new opportunities to expand and succeed. The learning material is light, not complex; most of the learning comes from the student's network and guest speakers.

""Checkmate"" removes country practices and allows candidates to understand the market competitiveness outside their boundaries. It provides students the opportunity to see and understand what large cities are doing and bring home the same innovative ideas. Checkmate helps entrepreneurs and business owners understand the power of strategies and plans. By comparing the failure of a tic-tac-toe, we can show them the advantages of studying the business game and succeeding through the process of strategic planning. A planning guide and textbook is also available for independent studies."

How was EntreSkills� I Developed? The Office of Entrepreneurial Education (oe2) worked with knowledgeable and experienced Business Advisors from the New York State Business Development Center (NYSSBDC) network to develop the lessons, exercises, test questions, and other components of the EntreSkills� I chapters. Since 1984, the New York State SBDC has been recognized as the premier business assistance program in the state, providing one-to-one counseling for more than 237,000 businesses, and helping them to save or create 113,000 jobs. Several of SBDC's highly qualified advisors applied their expertise and practical experience in the development and growth of small business to writing the EntreSkills� I chapters. The Teacher Resources section of the EntreSkills� I program was developed from recommendations provided by a Teacher Review Committee along with ongoing teacher feedback. There is no charge to New York State educators or students for using EntreSkills� I; oe2 asked teachers to provide feedback and share resources in exchange for access to the program.

Resulting Outcomes/Product/Services: Teacher training for EntreSkills� I is available via Web conferencing, providing teachers the ease of training at school or from home, M-F 8am - 3 pm EST. To assist school administrators and teachers in implementing EntreSkills� I, oe2 provides crosswalks that show how EntreSkills� I meets the following New York State learning standards and course requirements.

Through extensive research we have learned that regions who boast a healthy economy and high levels of prosperity are typically regions that also foster strong entrepreneurial environments. Much like the rest of the nation many counties in the WNC region has experienced significant job losses due to a number of plant closings. It is becoming more apparent to our local business leaders that in order to be competitive in today's global economy we must include entrepreneurship and small business as part of our economic development infrastructure and policy for the future of our country.

It is for this reason that in early 2007, AdvantageWest Economic Development Group took its entrepreneurial initiatives one step further down to the community level and created The Certified Entrepreneurial Community Program (CEC) to educate and empower local leaders with the critical foundational building blocks necessary to attract and retain entrepreneurs in their community.

The CEC Program consists of a five step process that is outlined in a guidebook that each approved leadership team is given at the onset of the certification process. Highlights of the program include the formation of a leadership team, community visioning, asset mapping, identification of entrepreneurial talent, comprehensive plan for including the youth in entrepreneurship, and streamlining the business licensing and permitting for entrepreneurs.

Upon successful completion of all required elements of the program, AdvantageWest is providing marketing for these communities as well as access to a revolving loan fund for qualified entrepreneurs, funding for last-mile telecom broadband, training for leadership teams and signage for communities.

Entrepreneurship or self-employment is particularly important in rural western North Carolina due to plant closures, displaced workers, and companies relocating outside the United States. Workers who once were employed in manufacturing and textile fields are now faced with going to work for service-based entities which, on average, pay the minimum wage to employees. Self-employment can be a viable option for increasing earning potential. All too often, individuals believe that self-employment may be an unrealistic goal; however, it may be the only option in rural areas where large manufacturing companies are no longer relocating."

This school year I am teaching Small Business and Sports & Entertainment Marketing during the spring semester.

I would also like to be able to increase the number of sections of Small Business I teach by showing students that Entrepreneurship is fun and not just about writing a business plan. If I can get current students talking about Entrepreneurship and all the fun that can be had, it will lead future students to be even more interested and eager to take Small Business Entrepreneurship."

Abstract: Haywood Community College Entrepreneurial Learning Team is developing models for integrating entrepreneurial competencies across the campus through an alternate strategic plan in the re-accreditation process with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

Two members from this team who have developed models in the cosmetology program and electronics engineering can provide an overview of HCC's Entrepreneurial Learning Initiative in the implementation phase and integration of HCC's entrepreneurial skills sets. Examples of how entrepreneurship/experiential classroom techniques will be integrated into curriculum programs will illustrate the use of Howard Garnder's multiple intelligences theory in lesson planning, coupled with collaborative learning strategies to enhance learning and transferability of knowledge to the workplace. Motivational strategies for the adult learner in an active learning environment are the foundation of the program.

Entrepreneurship Concepts were integrated in all administrative areas, such as decentralized budgeting, performance-based funding, customer service, and team training. As a result, the college has grown 52% in curriculum programs, 38% in non-credit programs, and the foundation has more than doubled during the last five years of the initiative.

In the classroom, two programs were selected to incorporate entrepreneurship-REAL and Cooperative Learning. Cooperative learning was selected as a tool to implement active collaborative learning. Team skills, communication, and adaptability are some of the Entrepreneurial Skills Sets identified that are promoted by cooperative learning, Gilliam was part of the HCC ELI Faculty Development Team who participated in cooperative learning training and implemented active learning strategies in the classroom.

Gilliam completed a study in January 2002, as part of the NCSU Adult and Community College Doctoral program in the assessment of the impact of the cooperative learning instructional strategy using the IDEA Center Student Survey Form of Courses and Instruction in all regular-schedule courses in the spring of 2001 at HCC. The study also measured how course learning environment factors impacted student ratings of instruction. Significant differences were found in comparing courses taught cooperatively and courses taught with the traditional format and on several of the course learning environment factors. An overview of the study and how cooperative learning was implemented in 54 courses across the campus in the spring of 2001 is available."

Abstract: The origins of the entrepreneurial learning initiative began in 1990, with collaboration with NC REAL on the need for entrepreneurship education at the postsecondary level. Haywood Community College was the first community college in the nation to implement the REAL Enterprises program. In 1996, the college started a self-study program in which the entrepreneurial learning initiative was further developed. HCC views entrepreneurial learning as the provision of focused entrepreneurial instruction in key programs, in addition to helping students and organizational members develop the ability to apply the traits and skills typically associated with entrepreneurs—e.g., responsibility, adaptability, teamwork—to their various learning challenges. A broad-based operational definition for the concept of entrepreneurship is used at Haywood. Entrepreneurs are those who see opportunities that others do not and marshal the resources to capitalize on them.

Several components work together collaboratively to give momentum to this initiative:

Every course syllabus at the college states the commitment made to teaching entrepreneurial skills to students, and each instructor lists the entrepreneurial skills included in the particular course.
Our professional crafts program has a long and established national reputation for preparation of graduates with exquisite technical skills coupled with real-world entrepreneurial skills.
The college is planning for the development of a regional Entrepreneurial Resource Center that will serve as a training center for faculty and staff, provide a research facility for students, and be a meeting place and resource center for potential entrepreneurs and established small-business owners.
Yearly entrepreneurial conferences are planned.
An ongoing entrepreneurial newsletter is published quarterly.
Since 1986, the college has housed a small business center that provides community outreach as well as an internal resource for the college.

Abstract:	The REAL course (Rural Entrepreneurship through Action Learning) is used here to help students identify and develop entrepreneurial talent, increase self-awareness and understanding, and develop criticl thinking and life skills. In the class, students will identify business opportunities within our local community, develop their business knowledge and skills, and produce a business plan for an enterprise of their own choosing. Students are required to have a business mentor for their project.

The REAL course is taught using the experiential learning style. Because most entrepreneurs are more interested in ""getting down to business"" than in reading about it, entrepreneurship does not lend itself to traditional teaching methods. Experiential methods work because they promote ownership, self-direction, and responsible decision-making, which are all qualities needed for successful business ownership"

Abstract: AMLP provides technical assistance, ongoing training, and loan capital to entrepreneurs who desire to start or expand a small business. The program is coordinated in partnership with the NC Rural Center and based on the Grameen Bank concept whereas entrepreneurs agree to network and support each other at bi-monthly meetings. Loan applications are approved or denied by the group members. This concept has proven successful due to the peer pressure set upon the members to make their payments. If one member is late with their payment or does not repay their loan the other group member's access to future loans are stopped.

In addition to the Microenterprise Program, the Small Business Ctr. provides REAL (Rural Entrepreneurship through Action Learning) classes, and various other professional small business classes. AMLP received the Site Excellence Award this year for exceeding its goals. Also, under the direction of Beth Henderson, AMLP holds the national record for managing a 0% delinquency/default loan portfolio. During the 2001-02 fiscal year, AMLP assisted 67 entrepreneurs resulting in the creation of 69 full time and 41 part time employee positions. The program assisted 26 existing/expanding small	businesses and 41 start-ups. This year AMLP received a $100,000 Community Development Block Grant to expand its service area to include Burke County."

The SBTDC's mission is to grow and develop North Carolina's economy by helping businesses successfully meet challenges, manage change and plan for the future. The organization carries out its mission by providing management counseling and educational programs to businesses across the state.

Of the more than 6,000 North Carolina clients counseled in 2001, three-quarters are existing businesses. Of those, 25% meet the definition of high-growth (meaning they experience 20 percent or more growth in annual revenues or in employment). Through our management counseling and educational services, the SBTDC helps these owners and managers gain knowledge essential to improving business practices, creating high-value products and services, and enhancing competitiveness. Our interactions may be brief or long-term, but our ultimate objective is to improve North Carolina's economy through job creation and increased tax revenues.

Businesses that have worked with the SBTDC have experienced a phenomenal 85-percent survival rate (when the national average is less than 40 percent over a six-year period). And our clients typically grow five times faster than the average for North Carolina small businesses.

We are now entering our 18th year as the US Small Business Administration's primary resource partner for small business development. Our close ties to The University of North Carolina's campuses make our efforts possible. We provide statewide procurement technical assistance-in 2001 alone, our clients received $340 million in government contracts-through our partnership with the Defense Logistics Agency. We help North Carolina businesses export their products and services through our partnership with the US Export-Import Bank, and we have served technology-based clients for many years as the North Carolina Biotechnology Center's outreach partner.

Abstract: NC REAL has over twenty years successful experience providing quality professional development for teachers who work with youth to implement school based enterprises, and small businesses within their communities. Successful teachers of youth entrepreneurship programs, like REAL, approach learning in an interactive, experiential manner that connects real-life economic decisions to students' daily learning experiences.

Everyone in economic and entrepreneurial development loves to talk about the importance of youth entrepreneurship, but few people know how to make it a concrete part of the development of their community. Through a grant from the Golden LEAF Foundation, NC REAL has been charged with tying youth entrepreneurship education with a regional economic development strategy-Advance Materials Manufacturing. The project is named BRIDGES- Building REAL Interest in Developing Greater Entrepreneurial Systems. Through this experience and several others NC REAL has learned how to create bridges between the community colleges and the K-12 school system and how to create youth entrepreneurship opportunities outside of the school system when necessary. Youth entrepreneurship can play a role in economic development if community leaders and developers see easy, tangible ways to make it part of the bigger strategy.

A major challenge facing rural America is assisting communities in restructuring their economic base from branch plant economies to homegrown economies that create sustainable economies. Experience has shown that with the right educational elements in place the business skills essential for success can be enhanced among many already in business so that their entrepreneurial spirit can be realized and they might ultimately become job makers rather than job takers.

NC REAL (Rural Entrepreneurship through Action Learning) Enterprises is committed to the mission of developing entrepreneurial talent through action learning and fostering the creation of sustainable enterprises with a special emphasis on rural communities. Therefore NC REAL, in partnership with the North Carolina Community College System and the Small Business Center Network, created a series of business development seminars and training called the Rapid Response Entrepreneurship Modules Training. The Rapid Response Modules grew out of the needs of the SBC directors to have more tools in their toolkit to better meet the varying needs of small business clients.

The eight modules are very distinct from the REAL curriculum and are targeted at clients who may already be in business, may have some entrepreneurial skills, but lack in depth knowledge of certain topics. The Rapid Response Modules provide them with additional skills and confidence in key areas of small business planning and development. With the assistance of the Small Business Center Network, NC REAL was able, through four statewide focus groups, to identify the competencies essential for each of the modules. Additionally, the modules address the five mandated areas of focus for educational programs by the North Carolina Small Business Center Network.

The Rapid Response Entrepreneurship Modules are:

Am I Cut Out to be an Entrepreneur?
Can My Business Idea Support Me?
Pricing Products and Services
Achieving Sales Projections through a Viable Marketing Plan
Let Your Numbers Do the Talking
Bookkeeping Basics
Tax Planning and Reporting
Taking Care of Taxes
The focus of the RR Training is to provide participants with professional development in the areas of experiential teaching methodologies, learning styles, using the Rapid Response Entrepreneurship Modules curricula; and course planning."

Our area has been hard hit by the loss of textile mills and the outsourcing of much of the furniture industry. We have also lost our largest employer, Alcoa. Thus, many of our students need training to begin small businesses in order to survive in this area.

In my foods program, I teach entrepreneurship. We learn basic skills and then brainstorm for ideas on small businesses we can operate for our live project. We learn about the basics of operating the small business and the responsibilities that go with it. Our goal is to operate a business for about six weeks each semester. Throughout the project we evaluate the business to see which areas we need to improve on and which areas are going well. Businesses we have had include mixes in a jar, meals-ready-to-go, cakes for sale, and lunches for faculty on Fridays.

My students also learn garnishing, bread making, catering, and cake decorating skills which could be used to start a small business. I have actually had students who completed the course and then went on to operate a business in cake decorating. Students are offered the opportunity to certify in Servsafe, a national restaurant program in food safety and sanitation. About 70% of my advanced level students do so. This, too, is an asset in operating a foods related business.

Abstract: The Career and Technical Education - Apparel Development I & II, Housing & Interior Design I program includes students from very low to lower middle class income families. The loss of most of our textile industry and much of the furniture industry in our area has changed the job market landscape tremendously. In order for our students to stay in their home community many will need the option of starting a small business.

In my advanced apparel development program we study how to develop usable entrepreneurial skills. We focus on the basics of operating a small business and the responsibilities involved. The students come up with several ideas for a business venture and make samples of their proposed products. The class votes on the final product that will be produced and sold as a class project. All students are then involved in the production from start to finish - using workplace readiness skills that are an integral part of our course objectives.

Some of the businesses my students have operated were ""Design Necessities"" - making designer belts, bracelets, and novelty key rings for purchase. They have made prom, baby, and birthday memory boards as special pre-paid orders. Some students have actually operated their own businesses - alteration services, designer tote bags, and theatrical costume construction. Another service we offer to our school is pressing and collar attachment for senior graduation gowns. The students learn to operate a business that requires little monetary investment, but rather time. This helps them understand the ""service industry"" more clearly and in a way that they can implement skills in their own homes without any significant overhead. This gives future ""stay-at-home moms"" an opportunity to add additional income to the family without leaving their children."

Purpose: We want all students, not just those in business programs, to see the value of thinking like entrepreneurs. If a student decides business ownership is not for them, the newly developed planning skills can make the student a more attractive employee in the workplace. Most organizations will need persons with entrepreneurial skills who can analyze and evaluate business opportunities. (Kauffman Foundation)


Phase I

Mary Dixon, Chair, Department of Management and Business Technologies, coordinates the Entrepreneurship Certificate Program. The Entrepreneurship Certificate is a one-or two-semester program that prepares the student for a new employment perspective. The certificate is offered to help students become entrepreneurial thinkers in order to start their own entrepreneurial ventures, to work on management teams of entrepreneurial ventures, or to apply their entrepreneurial abilities to an existing business.

The Entrepreneurship Program Certificate offers 6 essential courses. The courses in the 17-27 credit program cover basics such as QuickBooks Pro (accounting software application), business finance and small business management. Also included are classes in entrepreneurship, e-commerce and integrated management. We are partnering with the Kauffman Foundation to integrate the e-version of Planning the Entrepreneurial Venture, Student Workbook for Developing a Plan For a Start Up Venture into 4 of our Entrepreneurship Courses, providing the experiential component for building the business plan that will provide a better opportunity for students to learn this process. The courses are scheduled on Tuesdays and Thursdays during the day and evenings to minimize trips to the SCC campus. Some of the courses are available on-line or as a hybrid format of Internet and classroom teaching.

Sandhills Community College's Entrepreneurship Program uses the National Content Standards for Entrepreneurship Education which advocates not only learning about entrepreneurship but also experiencing it as part of the instructional process. This Toolkit for the National Content Standards for Entrepreneurship Education is designed to give the Standards and Performance Indicators framework necessary for developing curriculum for entrepreneurship programs as a lifelong learning process.

The Small Business Center at SCC plays an important role in the success of the Entrepreneurial Certificate Program.

The second and third phases of entrepreneurial training at SCC involve the creation and growth of an entrepreneurial network where alumni of the certificate program and members of the business community can network. Marilyn Neely, Director, SCC's Small Business, coordinates the new Sandhills Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership. The goal is to build a consortium of educators and business leaders who will guide new entrepreneurs and assist current business owners by offering educational opportunities such as academic instruction, mentorship and business plan creation.

Customized Training Workshops The Small Business Center offers a variety of non-credit training on topics in business, quality, and human resource issues throughout the year. Customized Ed-To-Go training program also makes online training possible.

Moore County Schools intends to offer Entrepreneurship I and II at the college level as part of their technical track.

With Governor Easley's help, SCC is a participant in the Learn and Earn initiative. Easley's plan calls for a network of ""early college"" high schools. Eventually, there will be a Learn and Earn school available to students in all 100 of the state's counties. SCC is partnering with Hoke County, to create one of the first ""early college"" high schools with 200 students through SansHoke.

Shadowing The students could be presented with numerous opportunities to build upon their skill sets with frequent interaction with the business community through the Chamber of Commerce. Shadow days could be incorporated whereby students shadow a successful entrepreneur. The students could have the opportunity to witness and learn the application of skills, such as negotiation from a seasoned entrepreneur.

Mentoring Sandhills Community College offers a Mentoring Program for students in the process of earning their Entrepreneurial Certificate and/or other equivalent or similar degree. The Program pairs a volunteer, who is an experienced professional, and/or business person and/or educator with a student of Business Administration for the purpose of enhancing and finalizing the student's own Business Plan. The goal is to fine tune the student's own Plan so that it might be used to provide helpful guidance for the proposed business as well as perhaps be used to seek investment capital and/or financing for the start-up business being contemplated.

Business Plan Capstone Course There will be an annual business plan practicum in which graduates of Entrepreneurship Program Certificate will have an opportunity to present their business plans to experienced members of the entrepreneurship community for valuable feedback and a chance to practice many of the skills and implement knowledge that are critical to entrepreneurial success.

The business community plays an important role in the success of the Entrepreneurial Certificate Program.


Phase III

Ted Natt, CEO and owner of the Sandhills Business Times, coordinates interaction with business leaders to provide a think tank for small business owners in the region. Research ongoing for a business incubator to support the graduates from the program.

Mentoring Graduates of the Entrepreneurship Program will have the opportunity to also present their business plans to an audience of angel investors. This experience will not only introduce the student to the local investor community (individual investors as well as lenders), but will also help determine whether the student may be offered to opportunity to be a tenant in the potential future business incubator.

Alumni Network To ensure Alumni awareness, a link on the SCC Entrepreneurship Program webpage provides information about activities, speakers, competitions and other events in the Department of Management & Business Technologies and the Small Business Center. We also have a link that includes a database of current students in the Program. Alumni stay informed, and current and future students have access to a large number of experienced individuals and potential mentors.

I have had students complete an entire Senior Project using their Business Plan.

A student several years ago wrote a paper describing how every level of student was able to succeed in the Small Business Entrepreneurship Class, as students who do not do as well in math and writing, excel when it comes to thinking creatively! It is very rewarding to me to have a student say, ""I thought this class was going to be boring, but now I really believe that I could open my own business.""

NC,Watts Consulting,none listed,"Focus: GROW YOUR BUSINESS-Helping entrepreneurs maintain valuable relationships with employees, suppliers and customers by using sound management techniques.

Abstract: People quit bosses-not jobs. The transition from idea person to business owner and manager is often very difficult for entrepreneurs. New business owners run the risk of losing customers, suppliers and valuable employees because they are forced to rely on a previously underdeveloped skill set. Leadership requires they be able to set priorities, delegate tasks, motivate and discipline employees and master a host of complex business communications techniques.

In order to grow a business, entrepreneurs need to have an accurate view of their management abilities as well as their financials. As a consultant, coach or educator you must be able to help business owners honestly assess their skills and then offer training to fill in the gaps. Interactive exercises and provocative discussions will uncover the strengths and weaknesses in management skills. ""So, now you're the boss"" is a workshop of how to information for managers and owners.

When coaching entrepreneurs towards business growth we need to understand the fears that keep people from effectively delegating, the two major communications agendas and the theories regarding employee motivation and discipline. However, presenting these theories and textbook ideas are not enough. We must empower entrepreneurs to make real world applications of these concepts. Jargon must be boiled down into regular words and business owners made comfortable with market language and technology. Most importantly, we as trainers must provide opportunities to practice new business skills in a safe environment and provide constructive correction before sending entrepreneurs into new management territory."

OH,ACEnet - The Student Entrepreneurship Training (SET) Program,www.acenetworks.org,"Focus: Rural development through entrepreneurship education

Abstract: The Student Entrepreneur Training (SET) Program is a project conceived and designed by the Technology Ventures Division of ACEnet, Inc., which next year will be taught in 20 area high schools in several rural counties in Appalachian Ohio. As part of the agreement with the schools, we provide 16 new computers and peripheral devices for each school. We install on these computers popular professional level graphics design, Web design and Microsoft® Office Suite software for students to use during the course.

The program provides high school students with the knowledge and skills to plan, develop, and start their own businesses. The curriculum is designed to maximize student collaboration, problem solving, as well as critical and creative thinking in a constructivist-learning environment. The latest technology is infused throughout the curriculum, providing students with a competitive edge in today's high-tech economy. We provide extensive training and support for teachers and students.

In the SET program, students initially work in teams to develop a mock business. They work through all aspects of creating a functioning business: determining legal structure, writing a mission statement, designing marketing materials (logo, flyer, business cards, Website), and calculating business financials. All of this will be compiled into a business plan. In the second half of the school year students will build on these skills to develop their own functional businesses. The intention is for their businesses to be up and running, generating income by the end of the school year.

The lessons within the SET curriculum were designed to be student-centered. The teacher assumes the role of guide or facilitator, helping students come to their own understanding of entrepreneurship. The curriculum is constructivist and experiential in nature and project-based, with long and short-term projects going on throughout the course. Students create their own understanding of entrepreneurship by participation in a range of business activities and projects. The projects are organized on the Learning Cycle model. The cycle is based in experience, utilizes reflection and then application in a continual cyclic process."

Abstract: In Ohio, the recognition of the state's philanthropy �gap� in its poorest rural communities generated an unprecedented commitment of public and private dollars to build sources of charitable capital in Appalachian Ohio. This 29-county region is home to 12% of the state's population but holds less than 2% of the state's charitable assets. As a consequence, Appalachian Ohio has far fewer grant dollars invested in and leveraged for its communities than when compared to the state as a whole. The Foundation for Appalachian Ohio (FAO) is a regional community foundation founded in 1998 to address the needs of the state's most impoverished and underdeveloped rural communities.

The Foundation seeks to build a better future for the region by building charitable endowment for regional and local grantmaking. Our core business is helping donors to achieve their charitable goals and connecting people who care with legacies that matter in Appalachian Ohio. As a trusted steward of charitable gifts, the Foundation is a regional vehicle through which permanent, charitable endowment is being attracted, invested, and used for good, forever, in Appalachian Ohio.

The Foundation's goals in economic and community development are to help foster and encourage interventions in Appalachian Ohio's economy that build on unique, regional economic opportunities. In Appalachian Ohio, �home-grown� businesses help create or retain jobs, increase individual assets, and strengthen local economies. To be successful regionwide in promoting entrepreneurship, the growth of the region's small businesses requires activities and strategies that support an entrepreneurial economy. The Foundation's priorities for the promotion of entrepreneurship include the following areas of activity:

Heritage tourism
Arts and craft cottage industries that focus on production of handmade objects
Outdoor and recreational enterprises
Production and marketing of specialty foods
Value-added agricultural enterprises
Horticultural enterprises
Healthcare and human services

Abstract: Harrison Hills Cottage Industries (HHCI), was developed in response to the collapse of the coal mining industry in Harrison County, the only significant source of employment in the area. With loss of employment by family bread winners, many local artisans sought a way to market their art, teach it to others and to share ideas. HHCI was developed as a vehicle to meet these needs.

HHCI currently operates a facility in Cadiz, Ohio were local folk art is marketed through its retail store, web site, trade shows and other marketing methods. In addition, participating artisans teach their crafts to others by presenting small classes and by cooperating with the industrial arts program in the local school district. It is an entirely volunteer organization with minimal paid staff and is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a tax exempt entity. HHCI has as one of its major goals to encourage state government support for the marketing of the works of Ohio artisans in facilities operated by the state."

Now that is definitely something to take ""aim"" at!! By allowing my students to touch and feel actual products and hooking them with tantalizing tales of how innovation, courage, resliliency, and hard work can pay off we inspire our kids to strive to ""stick their necks out"" to become successful entrepreneurs !

Students learned about themselves while learning about the achievements of various popular entrepreneurs. Tony Hawk, a skateboarding phenom, who now leads the company of his passion! A Kiteboarding entrepreneur? ""You mean I can be an entrepreneur in something I love to do??"" The possibilities are endless and the kids LOVE IT!!!

Unique Features or Results: Jim Grote, CEO of Donatos and now Olympic sponsor and local celebrity, treated all 412 of the 8th graders to a spectacular presentation highlighting his philanthropic gestures and amazing leadership achievements! All the kids wanted to be an entrepreneur after hearing him!!

Truly, there is not one of my students who does not know what an entrepreneuer is!! May I add that there is not one who won't strive to identify his or her strengths in pursuit of a life career or possibly a later entrepeneurial endeavor? Inspired by last year's Entrepreneurship Education Forum, I broadened the scope of entrepreneurship by deeming my 8th grade class ""The Give Back 'Class of 2012!"" We took on a cause, we supported websites of a philanthropic nature and we supported one of our 8th grade student entrepreneurs by ordering over 400 tee shirts from him, proclaiming that we indeed were the ""Give Back Class of 2012!

Social entrepreneurship accentuated how rewarding and vital it is that we all work to better others' lives which, in turn, better our own! Amazing results!!!! Being fortunate enough to have Jim Grote, CEO of Donatos, speak to my 8th graders was the perfect representative of ""Giving Back"" and extraordinary entrepreneurship since he faced adversity and overcame the odds by sticking HIS neck out!!! We all loved it!

I would like to see the district add entrepreneurship to its curriculum so all students can be inspired!!! Because of its far reaching impact in identifying individual strengths, thought provoking stimulation to 'life after high school"" and how critical it is to pursue what one believes in...Entrepreneurship should be more than just a ""buzz"" word!! The more our kids are exposed...the more they love it!!!"

Geographic Area: Throughout the 29 Appalachian Regional Commission counties of Ohio, including Athens, Meigs, Gallia, Morgan, Vinton, Hocking and Perry.

Products and Services: Provide skills that will enable fish to be raised in existing small water resources for food and recreation. The formation of business cooperatives will be encouraged to assist with marketing fish to larger markets that are beyond the scope of an individual.

Age Level: Anyone who is interested

Key Partners: Appalachian Regional Commission, Ohio Bed and Breakfast Association, ACEnet, Community Food Initiatives (Athens).

Abstract: Readily available water sources are plentiful throughout the Appalachian region - farm ponds, gravel pits, strip mine impoundments and private ponds and/or lakes - provide ideal sources for raising fish in cages. Data indicate the demand for fish (either for the table or for sport) outnumbers what is being produced and fish farming offers income and employment opportunities.

By utilizing the fish hatchery at Lake Snowden Education and Recreation Center (owned by Hocking College) specialized courses taught by experts will provide skills and knowledge for successful fish farming ventures. Hand-constructed cages built specifically for this use and to accommodate conditions of each individual water source make raising fish to the desired market size easier. Cage culture equipment and techniques offer the flexibility to be adaptable to species variations as well as water sources.

Partnerships with Ohio State University's Research Laboratory at Piketon provides access to constant research regarding improvements in fish production and testing the commercial feasibility of various species and rearing techniques. Through collaborative efforts with ACEnet's Kitchen Food Incubator and Community Food Initiatives (both in Athens) food products will be developed and marketed and opportunities for entrepreneurs are created."

Summer Youth Program",none listed,"Focus: Elementary And Middle School Youth In The Community

Abstract: The neighborhood for this program was Weinland Park, an area to the south and east of OSU. Of the 2,257 households, 535 received public assistance in 1990; thus, many of these households are in the welfare-to-work population. About half of all households are female-headed families, and only 30 percent of the population above age 25 have a high school degree or equivalency. The 1990 census reported 17 percent of the population to be unemployed and just over half of the population to have incomes below the poverty level. Community meetings conducted as part of a Community Outreach Partnership Center project identified activities for young teens as a need in the community. This project addressed that need.

This was a five-week pilot program that focused on computer skill development, team building, problem solving, and introduction to business operations. A total of 23 youth ranging in age from 6 to 14 years and living in the Weinland Park Community took part in the summer program.

The specific application taught during the program was development of basic computer skills related to use of a high-tech embroidery sewing machine. Each participant learned to use the computer, linked a computer-generated design to the sewing machine software and operated the machine to execute a design on an article of clothing. In addition to designing and learning to use the machine, the participants developed a business name and logo and learned basic business skills.

During the five weeks, project leaders discussed various aspects of operation of a business that produces custom embroidered products. These discussions were designed to prompt their thinking about career possibilities and establishing a small business. Participants responded very positively to the idea of establishing a small business for young people in the neighborhood and pledged their continued participation.

An additional component of the program was a service project. The objective of this effort was to introduce the principle of investing or contributing to the neighborhood. The youth decided to design and ""manufacture"" t-shirts embroidered with the summer program logo and to give the t-shirts to children at the Homeless Families Foundation. The program was definitely a success. Participants attended regularly; they walked to the location (The Human Ecology House) each week and were ready to begin work. They were eager to continue with the program and have continued to ask when the program will start again.

Therefore, the next step is to establish youth in a small embroidery business in 2001. The objective is to build self-esteem, create enlarged views of possible careers and educational training, and develop problem solving, team-building and technical skills and knowledge of operating a business enterprise.

Geographic Area: Ohio

Products and Services: Workshops

Age Level: Adults

Abstract: Starting a small or home-based business might be rewarding, both personally and financially. In fact, there are more than 15 million home-based businesses in the United States. Over the past few years, businesses with fewer than 50 employees have accounted for almost two-thirds of new jobs, according to Dun and Bradstreet surveys (Small Business Success, Volume VII, 1994).

Although small-business development can be a successful economic development strategy because of the potential positive ramifications, research has documented that close to 60 percent of new businesses fail in the first five years of existence. First-time entrepreneurs seldom know every aspect about business management techniques, marketing, government regulations, and/or business plans.

Ohio State University Extension has developed the Beyond a Dream: Starting Your Own Small or Home-Based Business series. This series of specialized workshops—ranging from ""Food Creations from the Home"" to ""Marketing Crafts"" to ""Food Concession Trailers""—help individuals develop their business ""dreams into realities"" by providing them with practical information on the fundamentals of starting their own business, including practical information on licenses, permits, regulations, record keeping, pricing, legal organization, marketing, the development of a business plan, and the effects of the business on the family.

The program addresses ways for families to strengthen their financial stability through small or home-based business development."

Abstract: One of the primary focuses on entrepreneurship specific to the RUHL community over the past four years is the ability to find new opportunities to utilize the resources once used in tobacco production. The Ripley community is currently in the middle of an economic crisis in regard to income generated from the production and sale of tobacco. It is estimated that the loss of income from tobacco is over twenty million dollars a year, not counting the number of times that money circulates in the community.

The Ripley Union Lewis Huntington (RUHL) agriculture education program exposes all high school students to the entrepreneurship opportunities through the teaching of the competencies found in the curricula of both the AgriBusiness and the AgriScience programs. Over the past eight years it is estimated that over 500 students have had exposure to the production and marketing of hydroponically grown crops using locally available resources. The same information was also presented to over seventy-five adults in the community and over 150 agriculture education instructors throughout Ohio.

As with any change in a community that is deeply rooted and concentrated in a specific type of agriculture production, they feel it is going to take years to see appreciable differences. Concentrating the education to youth of the agriculture program will allow for more subtle changes that are beginning to be accepted as current agricultural practices."

Abstract: Student Enterprise Program (StEP) engages students and teachers in the design and operation of a functioning market economy in their schools. In StEP, students create a miniature society that mirrors the ""real world;"" they form their own government, develop student-run businesses, earn, spend, save and invest school currency. StEP provides students with financial education, all while engaging them in the core academic curriculum. Over the years, the program has increased student attendance rates and raised achievement scores in over 25 schools.

StEP changes schooling from what is often a passive experience to one that gives the student responsibility and opportunity to make choices. The core academic curriculum in StEP schools is taught through practical experiences. In StEP, students are given a sense of purpose in school, a job and a feeling of accomplishment.

To date, StEP has been implemented in schools across Southwestern Ohio engaging every ethnic and socio-economic group. StEP is an investment in our future citizens. StEP emulates a world with a real possibility of success and empowers students to strive and achieve.

This initiative targets students in grades 3-5 and involves students creating student run businesses in their classrooms. They bring their items that they have created to an event called Market Madness in May each year and sell them (for school based currency- not real money) to each other. There are 31 schools participating. Businesses range from necklace making, pretzels dipped in chocolate, journals, etc� They come to the University of Cincinnati to buy, sell and take a tour of campus. Twenty of the thirty one schools are inner city Cincinnati Public School youth. It is a great program and teaches students to be empowered to make choices, see a reason for staying in school and provides leadership through decision making."

Abstract: The U.C. Center for Entrepreneurship Education and Research, established in 1997, seeks to create a world-class center for entrepreneurship education, research, and service. The center's vision and mission is to provide a state-of-the-art entrepreneurship curriculum not only for potential entrepreneurs, but also for people in the many organizations that interact with small, entrepreneurial and family owned businesses on a daily basis. Located in the Department of Management in the CBA, the Entrepreneurship Center seeks collaborative efforts between students from across the University. The CBA offered its first entrepreneurship course in 1972, and founded the Goering Center for Family Business in 1987. In 2001, Success Magazine named U.C. one of the top 50 Entrepreneurship programs in the U.S.

Center research focuses on enhancing our understanding of entrepreneurial career choice, inclinations to launch new ventures, and practical suggestions to enhance firm survivability once launched. In addition, past research focuses on increasing international opportunities in emerging markets and U.C. is one of the founding members of the Entrepreneurship Research Consortium (ERC) dedicated to a longitudinal examination of new venture creation from nascency.

The Center's activities include:

a faculty-guided, student-based field case study program which provides consulting services for local businesses (Small Business Institute Program),
the Young Entrepreneurs Seminar (YES), a day-long event for high school seniors to meet and exchange ideas with local entrepreneurs,
the CBA MBA New Venture Business Plan Competition,
CEO Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organization, and
the Cecil Boatright Business Plan Case Competition for undergraduate students (with a new competition in planning which will be open to students from four area universities).

Successful entrepreneurs do not need to be accountants. But they do need to understand how to use accounting to help manage their business. However, students often find it boring, with too many numbers, and too much math. Cash flow, budgeting, income statements, and other elements of accounting often leave students bored and restless. The required attention to detail can leave students frustrated. Techniques that engage students have been used successfully in a year-long entrepreneurship course taught to high school students. The goal of these accounting lessons is to give students an understanding of how to apply accounting to the management of their business."

Abstract: This program is for high school teachers to discover an existing course developed with them in mind. It is an online course that is taught entirely using the Internet and email, and it was especially designed for high school teachers with busy schedules. The course consists of ten assignments to be completed over a ten-week quarter. Each lesson has one or more student-centered activities that reinforce the topic covered. The student activities are designed to be completed in 50-60 minutes. Answer keys are provided for teachers.

The high school teacher participant is directed to several websites per assignment covering the topic ""Entrepreneurship: Starting a Business."" The participant will then evaluate the material covered and the student related activities. The expected evaluation is generally 2-3 typed pages. A major plus for teachers is that they can work at their leisure since the Internet is available twenty-four hours per day. This course has been field tested by high school teachers in Ohio and Michigan and resulted in several important improvements. The field test was extremely valuable since the teachers provided critical evaluations from the professional user's point of view."

Revitalization of a Rustbelt Community",none listed,"Focus: Four-year colleges and universities establishing entrepreneurship centers

Abstract: The purpose of this program is to aid those colleges that are exploring the option of introducing a entrepreneurship center within a region that has faced economic hardship. While all university entrepreneurship centers serve as a heart of curriculum development efforts, and most serve as a resource to the local business community, it is the aim of our center to aid the revitalization of the regional economy.

Youngstown State University (YSU), a state university of approximately 12,500 students, is located in the Mahoning Valley in northeastern Ohio. Until the 1970s, the economy of the region was heavily dependent upon the steel industry. Then, in October 1977, the area's largest steel producer shut down. It has taken nearly 20 years for the economy to recover from this impact. The valley has rebuilt its economy through diversification in both the service and manufacturing sectors.

The valley is home to major international corporations such as GM-Lordstown, Delphi Packard Electric Systems, and Commercial Intertech, but the majority of the area's employment is in small and medium-sized companies in industries such as steel, metal fabrication, and aluminum extrusion. In the tri-county area that comprises the Mahoning Valley, there are over 16,000 businesses with fewer than 200 employees, and 15,446 businesses with less than $25 million in sales. A major goal of our center is aid this continuing revitalization."
OK,Cache High School,www.cacheschools.com,"Abstract: The Doghouse,a School-Based Enterprise, is managed by Entrepreneurship Class and operated by Marketing classes where each student gets work-based learning and includes CHTV Dog 1 News where we advertise our store, with student produced commercials, on the weekly newscast prepared by Sports & Entertainment Marketing class.

The school includes rural students in southwest Oklahoma from all ethnic backgrounds, a large population of Native Americans and many military families as we are close to Ft. Sill Army Base. These culturally diverse students are also economically diverse with 30% on free and reduced lunches while others have physicians and professionals for parents. In my Entrepreneurship class, the strongest young man is the son of a Ford dealership owner/entrepreneur who said he enrolled in my class because his career goal is to be an entrepreneur.

I started my marketing department on a part-time basis because the school didn't feel it could afford to pay a full-time teacher; the rest of the day I taught special education. We baked cookies and sold them on a mobile cart to fund the DECA activities for the students in marketing. When I was allowed to have a full-time marketing program, my Entrepreneurship Class wrote a proposal to the principal to make the bathroom across the hall from my room into a small school store where we could sell our cookies and some snacks. It was approved and we decorated it as a 50s diner with black and white tiles on the floor, red walls with neon lights.

This year as my program has grown to over 100 students, we needed to expand the store again and were discussing different plans to present to the principal. We have been given the old gym concession, and it is very big. Especially compared to a two-stall bathroom. We have purchased furniture that looks like a 50s diner, painted the walls and added shiny aluminum to make it very special. We have also expanded our hours. The 9th grade will be moving into their new building at Christmas and so have their own lunch period. This is when the Entrepreneurship managers train the 9th grade marketing students in real-work experience and operate the store. We also operate the store during 10-12 lunch with those marketing students gaining real work experience. We have been working out the operational differences in the new location and plan on having a ""Grand Opening"" with free drinks, prizes, and special activities October 6-10. This has required fliers, posters, TV commercials, etc.

Many of my marketing students have gone on to college majoring in some aspect of things learned in my class: business, banking (we had a small savings bank in our original store), TV broadcasting after Dog 1 News, communications after making commercials and finding out they were good at it. I received a $40,000 grant to set up a professional TV studio in the high school for our weekly Dog 1 Newscasts. I have partnered with Cameron University at Lawton through Dr. Jenkins, TV Broadcasting teacher to help me purchase the correct equipment, set it up correctly, and then to train the students to operate the control booth, cameras, and be the anchors.

The most important results are the students themselves who choose to take not just one of the marketing classes I teach, but most of them take all of them: Marketing/TV Broadcasting essentials, Elements of Entertainment (where we make movies and will end with a documentary), Entrepreneurship (in charge of The Doghouse), Fashion Marketing (the 4th annual with theme ""Hollywood Walk of Fame""), and Sports and Entertainment Marketing producing the weekly CHTV Dog 1 News. I got a grant to put TVs in the classrooms which are connected to the TV in my room where we show the news via DVD player to the high school classes. I also have convinced the local cable network to give us a cable channel out of my room Bulldog Channel 70, where my students market the events of the entire school district with a 24/7 power point and evening sports game replays."

Abstract: The primary audience for this curriculum is students in their late teens and early 20s or in college or technical/community college. The curriculum focuses on the non-business student who either does not have time, cannot get into already full classes, or simply wants to explore what is involved in starting a business. The curriculum could be used in senior high schools or in adult education. Although developed for a one-hour credit course, it can easily be used in a non-credit manner also.

Today's college student, like the rest of society, has a desire to participate in the American dream of being his or her own boss. Entrepreneurship programs in business schools are seeing rapid and continued growth as students prepare for business ownership (Vesper & Gartner, 1997).

Yet the desire to own a business is not limited to only students in business schools. Stanforth and Muske (1999) found 83% of students in family and consumer sciences programs anticipated owning a business. These students have the skills and abilities that can be developed into a thriving business. Yet they also indicated a need for entrepreneurship training in order to increase their chances of success.

The purpose of the material is to help and encourage educators to introduce entrepreneurship concepts to students through a two-part series. Education has been linked to successful business development (Danco, 1994). This series of courses will provide a formal start in how to develop one's own business. Most small business owners start a business for reasons such as: independence/control; increased income opportunities; additional family or personal time; quality of life; or disillusionment with corporate America (Brabec, 1994; Buck, 1997). Students in non-business degrees are also motivated by such desires (Stanforth & Muske, 1999). Education can increase the likelihood of success. Yet often the non-business students often cannot get into entrepreneurship classes, even with their rapid expansion, because of space limitations and already full class schedules. It is important that students be given the chance to explore themselves as a business owner as part of their career development efforts.

With the significant expressed need for entrepreneurship education among non-business students, a Coleman grant proposal was funded to develop the two 1-credit course series, ""An Exploration of Entrepreneurship."" The first course, ""Turning Your Passion Into a Career,"" explores the process of understanding the market, getting the business idea, honing that idea into a workable business, targeting a market, and then promoting the business.

The second course, ""Making a Living from Your Passion,"" deals with the management and financial aspects of operating a business. It includes developing a business plan, business financing, pricing and record keeping.

The series is intended as an introduction to entrepreneurship. The two courses will introduce the student to crucial business concepts in a successful business. The courses have been geared towards the non-business student who may have not had accounting, marketing or management courses. Each course is a complete unit and includes lecture notes, PowerPoint slides, student workbooks, and activities."

It includes the opportunity for high school students to apply entrepreneurial concepts to the operation of a school based enterprise that does not take the entire school year and works with fifth grade students too..

Abstract: Most students live in Ponca City which has a population of approximately 26,000, but over one third of the student body is bussed in from rural areas. Approximately 3% of our student body comes from smaller towns around Ponca City. These students choose Ponca City High School over their local high school due to the variety of course offerings.

Ponca City is the largest school in Kay County, Oklahoma with a school enrollment of 1600. Of these 1600, 225 students enroll in one of my classes each school year. This program services a diverse population of high school students. Those who enroll range from low to high income. It services 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th graders. Academic levels are as diverse as the income, race, and sex.

This program is designed to start students thinking about the possibility of being an entrepreneur. Starting a student's freshman year, they can take entrepreneurship awareness and progress into higher level courses such as business management and entrepreneurship. While in this program, students not only learn about entrepreneurship but help to teach other students through hands-on activities that the students develop and coordinate. These activities include the coordination of a county-wide entrepreneurial fair, presentations at local elementary schools as well as actually operating a holiday store at a local elementary school. Through these hands-on practices students reinforce what they learn in the classroom.

The uniqueness of this program is that it is the only entrepreneurial program in Kay County, Oklahoma that services high school students. Students who are deemed at risk have entered the program and because of the hands-on practices of the program become interested in school and their future. Those not at risk, gain valuable practical skills for their future. By incorporating a variety of hands-on activities, her students have excelled in the classroom and DECA competition at both the state and national level which deal with entrepreneurship. Many of her students have chosen to go into business for themselves

Unique features of this program include a yearly entrepreneurial fair that is attended by juniors and seniors at Ponca City High School and seniors from across Kay county. At this fair, students are able to talk with local entrepreneurs and see that anyone can be an entrepreneur.

In addition, senior level students work with a local elementary school to teach entrepreneurial concepts through the incorporation of a holiday store. At this store, fifth graders are given one share of stock in the holiday store. As stock holders, they have a vested interest in the store. In addition to being stock holders, they serve as employees of the store so that they can experience working with the public. The high school entrepreneurial students serve as the board of directors and spend months determining promotion, merchandising, training needed, etc. in order to make this joint entrepreneurial adventure a success. Once the holiday season is over, an income statement is constructed. When the profit is determine, each elementary student is presented with a certificate showing the value of the stock they owned in the company. This stock is then used by the fifth graders to purchase something for their school to leave as legacy as they enter middle school."

PA,BERNELLI FOUNDATION,www.bernelli.org,"Abstract: : The Bernelli doctorate in entrepreneurial leadership is designed to model key components of entrepreneurial thinking. As teachers learn to integrate their expertise with the basics of entrepreneurship, students are offered an education which not only prepares them for the future, but allows them to also become innovators of the future.

Entrepreneurial cognitive research offers interesting possibilities for educators acting as change agents for the future of young children within the educational system. Educators are social entrepreneurs who are experts in learning and cognition, but most lack the skills in how to become change agents within a bureaucratic educational system. Current research in the area of entrepreneurial cognition combines the expertise of both fields and offer exciting options for educators.

As school choice legislation and charter programs grow in popularity as true options for those who desire change in the educational system, entrepreneurial leadership in such innovative programs becomes critical to the success of such systemic change. Programs in entrepreneurial leadership offer educators an opportunity to learn to think entrepreneurially and grow in understanding the basic components of entrepreneurial cognition. Entrepreneurial cognition is shaped by an individual's network of social relationships and is linked to an individual's overall success as an adult leader. The Bernelli doctorate in entrepreneurial leadership is design to model key components of entrepreneurial thinking. As teachers learn to integrate their expertise with the basics of entrepreneurship, students gain a real opportunity for an education which not only prepares them for the future, but allows them to also become innovators of the future.

PA,GOT CRAYONS?,www.gotcrayons.org,"Abstract: This program is a voluntary approach to reach out to the community and have an unparalleled impact upon its youth. We provide students access to tools, information, and other resources necessary to unleash their fullest potential. We create an environment in which these students can unlock their minds, explore vast new resources, and soar with endless possibilities. We are a new organization in Chester County dedicated to helping the children of our community reach their fullest potential and believe in the beauty of their dreams.

Researchers increasingly conceptualize poor educational performance as the outcome of a process of disengagement that may begin as early as a child's entry into school (Finn, 1989; Kelly, 1989; Merchant, 1987; Rumberger, 1987; Natriello, 1984). According to this model, students who do not identify with, and participate and succeed in, school activities become increasingly at risk of academic failure and dropout. In order to improve student achievement and persistence, the model suggests that the school climate must foster ""investment"" behavior—schools must encourage student involvement in academic and extracurricular activities by stimulating their interest, increasing their personal resources (e.g., remediating skill deficiencies), and rewarding their efforts.

At C.H.A.N.C.E. we are developing a continuum of after-school programs that cover elementary, middle, and high school levels. At the elementary school level we are building general after-school programs. Homework help, academic tutoring, and enrichment programs including drama, art, music, dance, and much more, will be the basis of the program. The middle school program will be a content-based, exploratory technology program. We will offer the kids a chance to learn about several different aspects of technology. We have developed an entrepreneurship curriculum for grades three through five and have begun teaching it to at-risk youths.

The kids will learn about the areas of Web development, graphic design, networking, scripting, multimedia, etc., by actually working together to develop content ""by kids, for kids, about kids."" This hands-on approach will allow them to explore their creative and technical talents and interests. At the high school level, we move away from an exploratory model and move into a skill-building model. The purpose here is to provide kids the opportunity to develop a significant skill set that will make them marketable by the end of their time with us. We will teach kids about advanced Web development, multimedia, networking, programming, graphic design, etc. This will also be a hands-on, content-based program. Kids will learn by producing publishable content, be it a Web site, printed material, or full-scale television production that is ""by kids, for kids, about kids.""

Our first step is to develop a program at Caln Elementary School in the Coatesville Area School District. This program will be volunteer based, pulling on student volunteers from local universities and high schools, as well as community volunteers. We will work with the kids, using student and community volunteers, twice a week after school in a general after-school program. The program will consist of homework workshops, academic tutoring, and enrichment activities.

Service projects will also be an integral part of the program. The kids will help serve the community by doing several different mini projects (ie, making cards for the elderly, cleaning up parts of the school, making food/gift baskets for the needy, etc.). The program will be supervised by a school staff member but coordinated primarily by student and community volunteer leaders. "

Abstract: ""The Buzz"" is the first and only educational program of its kind - a comprehensive series to teach entrepreneurial skills to children ages 10 - 15 through the use of television and the internet. Just recently, after five years in development, 13 episodes of The Buzz has been contracted to appear on the Starz Encore cable network's commercial-free children's channel, WAM, beginning January, 2002. The cable channel goes to 10 million homes nationwide and 80,000 schools through Cable to the Classroom.

A corresponding internet site will feature monthly newsletter for children, parents, and teachers and additional curriculum materials for classroom use. These will include other resources along with pre and post activities for each lesson along with vocabulary words. To encourage expanded usage, each episode is designed to meet the national social studies standards and the national economics standards. The entrepreneurial environment of a family business serves as the backdrop to study the issues.

Along the way the children learn new ""Buzzwords"", and gain exposure to teen entrepreneurs and business in other parts of the country and throughout the world. Throughout the adventure, the gang learns the importance of teamwork, dedication, and good business sense, all with a little help from their guide, creator, Dr. Cindy.

Dr. Cindy Iannarelli is the driving force behind the design, development, and continuing success of this project. At a very young age she learned many entrepreneurial skills helping in the family dry cleaning store. She saw that children could benefit from an entrepreneurial education early in life, and the value it would have on a child's choices throughout life.

She created the first business plan competition for teens in 1983 and the first seminar for entrepreneurial parents in 1984, and entrepreneurial camps in the early 90's when she served as the training coordinator at the Small Business Development Center. She then went on to consult with family businesses, speak at their trade meetings, and train their young children. Her work in the field led her to founding the Center for Family Business at Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1995.

Her work with children has been recognized by many organizations including the Small Business Administration, The National Federation of Small Business, The Freedoms Foundation, The Family Firm Institute, and numerous media sources including The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Nation's Business, and Entrepreneur Magazine."

Abstract: Biz Buds is an active interdisciplinary partnership in Entrepreneurship. High School students and grade three students combined economics and entrepreneurship to produce a cookie jar product sold at Christmas. This thematic unit also includes language arts (reading and written language) math, decision making, and cooperative group work. The objective of the project was to have students acquire experience and construct knowledge in order to resolve the problem. Students discussed alternative solutions to the plans. Students performed a business alliance and worked together cooperatively. Students marketed and sold an innovative product. Students learned and applied customer service. Students improved communication skills through teaching or just having lunch with their ""buddies"". Students learned the importance of community charity.

We began with both groups of students reading together Max Malone Makes A Million, by Charlotte Herman. High School students formulated their teaching theory of economic principles for grade three. On the first visit, students were already familiar with their ""buddies"". Students wrote letters and exchanged pictures before the initial meeting. The initial visit was a teaching scenario of economics which taught the elementary students productive, natural, human, and capital resources. The high school student designed the product. The students had lunch together at the elementary school. A video called Ump Fwat was shown. Ump was the first cave man entrepreneur. After the first visit, the entire high school group did not attend. Specific teaching groups were sent. On the second visit, trade, scarcity, supply and demand were taught with the noticeable absence of the high school teacher. Lesson 3 taught market, customers, market survey, income, expenses, and profit. All the while the high school students went on a trip to do comparative pricing, and preparation for making the product. Both groups of students did marketing surveys and then they were compared.

The last lesson was marketing. Students learned from the high school students about target market, advertising etc. Finally, the banker arrived at the elementary school with his brief case, three piece suit, and three very well dressed high school students. This was a completely new personality, another business teacher with $500 in real cash!!! The students needed to get a loan. He was the man. The grade three students had to present a mini business plan, fill out a loan application, and make him understand why they needed money.

The next activity combined both classes. At the high school, the students prepared a division of labor activity in which we prepared 150 cookie mix jars in 1.5 hours. (including lunch in the high school cafeteria). But, the project was not over. Grade three now learned about the stock market and how companies need to go public to get additional monies. Then profits were calculated and donated to the school library."

The Youth LIFE Program provides students with a safe and educational place to spend their weekday afternoons. The program includes the implementation of training opportunities, job shadowing, age- and skill-appropriate tutorial classes, educational seminars, self-improvement classes, cultural field trips, recreational activities, and community service projects. The program operates five days a week for the duration of the school year. The Human Services Center is open until 10:00 p.m. on weeknights, affording a safe place for youths to participate in activities until their parents leave work.

The program begins with youths engaging in recreational activities from 2:30 p.m. until 3:30 p.m. Following recreation, youths can attend an educational seminar from an external agency for one hour. The remainder of their time will be spent doing homework and using on-site tutorial services, going on cultural trips, working on community service projects, as well as attending training and entrepreneurship workshops.

Youths involved in the Youth LIFE Program also have the opportunity to participate in job shadowing day activities, the Carnegie Science Center Biz Camp, and several entrepreneurship workshops. Activities such as Roller Coaster Tycoon, career cluster identification games, and resume writing and interview skills instruction are offered to interested youths.

Having the Youth LIFE Program at a central, convenient location such as the Human Services Center allows youths from various regions of the Monongahela Valley to take advantage of the academic services and resources offered at the center."

Geographic Area: Puerto Rico

Abstract: In recent years entrepreneurship education programs have been growing rapidly in the various universities and colleges both in the United States and here in Puerto Rico. A number of colleges in Puerto Rico offer a variety of courses and programs on entrepreneurship.

Following a brief overview of the salient features of these courses in PR Universities this paper addresses the issue of 'To what extent students taking entrepreneurship courses are likely to became entrepreneurs. To study this issue a comparative survey of university students taking entrepreneurship courses and the general student body is being undertaken. A survey study of a sample of 1432 students with different majors in several university campuses in PR is undertaken. The survey aims to asses the extent to which college students are interested in pursing entrepreneurial activity. This survey is followed by another survey of students (approximate sample 200) undertaking entrepreneurship courses to identify their tendency to pursue entrepreneurial activity. The comparative survey study and statistical analysis will allow us to identify any statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to their expected entrepreneurial activity pursuit.

The questionnaire is being designed to also help identify the impact of the courses to motivate students to look into entrepreneurial activities as a life style choice. Further the survey will help to identify the course components, topics and classroom activities that contribute to student's satisfaction with the courses as well as their confidence"

The Rhode Island Youth Entrepreneurship Program is an educational community outreach initiative of the Rhode Island MicroEnterprise Association, Inc.

This program is designed to invigorate and motivate students in 9-12 grades to dream, pursue and take action on achieving greater goals in their lives. The program began in a single high school in 2002. Today, the program is offered statewide at 15 high schools that encompass both inner-city and urban settings. This program offers a 21-week program, at no cost to the schools. Each program is embedded in an existing business class and is delivered each week in partnership with the high school classroom teacher. All of the students and teachers gather at an annual Youth Entrepreneurship Day event (April 12, 2005). There are 20 high schools currently on the program's waiting list. The goal is to deliver this dynamic interactive program at all 70 of Rhode Island's public and private high schools.

In the meantime, the Association has begun efforts to introduce this program to students in the middle and elementary schools of the state. A pilot program for the elementary schools will commence in January 2005.

This program is funded entirely by private contributions. There are no local, state or federal funds provided for the implementation of this educational program."

Abstract: The Walhalla High School Entrepreneurship program promotes a climate for idea generation that leads to and connects with opportunity recognition. The program was begun in 1998, and now enrolls 48 students; in fact, 26 students were turned down in 2001 due to lack of an available period to teach the class! This year, over 40 new student businesses were created in the entrepreneurship program. One student business, Marketplace Restaurant, is now in its third year of operation, and five other student businesses have been operating for multiple years, including a goat farm and a produce stand.

The program has two course components. In Entrepreneurship I, students are engaged in higher order thinking activities and are challenged to ""think out of the box."" In Entrepreneurship II, students as a class develop a school-based business.

In Entrepreneurship I, students develop an Entrepreneurship Ledger to reflect their growing knowledge base. They research famous and local entrepreneurs, and identify entrepreneurial characteristics. Students develop a business idea and work alone or in groups to create a Business Venture Portfolio. Students present this Business Venture Portfolio to an EntreBoard, a community-based panel that interviews the student, views the portfolio, and determines whether the EntreBoard will provide resources to back the venture.

In Entrepreneurship II, students develop a school-based business as a class. Students are divided into committees to research all aspects of opening and operating a business: market survey, securing capital, bookkeeping, pricing, and inventory control. The business opens only after all research and planning are complete. The business is evaluated each week by the class; problems are addressed and necessary changes made.
WaIhalla High School is committed to entrepreneurship; it builds success among disenfranchised students, especially females from low-income families. Entrepreneurship is a great leveler; students from all programs work together, including those from honors programs, technical programs, college prep programs, ESL programs, exchange programs, and programs for students with learning disabilities.

An entrepreneurship component is now taught to all 9th grade students, introducing them to entrepreneurial thinking as soon as they arrive on the high school campus. Seven high school teachers have been trained in the tenets of entrepreneurship, and all three area elementary schools have been assisted in adding entrepreneurship as a component of their social studies curriculum."

In 2006, Four Bands continued to pilot test strategies to plant the seeds of entrepreneurship and money management among youth. This work evolved into a new program call Wicoicage Sakowin kin un Wicakagapi: Building for the Seventh Generation. Starting in September 2007, Four Bands and other partners started working with the Cheyenne-Eagle Butte Schools and Tiospaye Topa School (located 45 miles to the east of Eagle Butte on the Cheyenne Reservation) to implement money management and entrepreneurship education. In the 2008-2009 school year, we are expanding into two more schools on the reservation. Another component is to offer youths paid entrepreneur internship experiences with a portion of the earnings placed in a savings account Four Bands will match. The funds are only available for asset-producing goals-to pursue higher education, start a business, or purchase a home. We will continue to add partners and grow the program until all youths on the Reservation have successfully learned and applied skills that lead to long-term employment and financial success.

Abstract: Northeast State Technical Community College has created a ""real world"" approach to teaching small business management with an associate degree program targeted for start-up or established entrepreneurs who seek the tools for success. This program is in its fifth year and has produced entrepreneurs in a host of businesses in areas such as antiques sales, motorcycle sales and service, computer technology, professional recruiting, woodworking, tax preparation, and retailing.

The core small business classes deal with every aspect of a small business, including business planning, taxes and licensing, marketing, financial analysis, operations, and human relations. The other associate degree courses complement the practical, workable emphasis of this program approach. Frequent guest speakers and input from a local advisory committee maintain the courses' focus on providing the United Statesable essentials for the budding (or experienced) entrepreneur.

This unique degree program has been sanctioned by the Tennessee Board of Regents and recently received national accreditation by the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs. The local Tennessee Small Business Development Center and Service Corps of Retired Executives refer their clients to this practical program. In turn, the department has teamed with these groups to produce spin-off workshops, such as a ""Street MBA"" certificate, for entrepreneurs not able to accommodate the time for a degree program.

TN,Tennessee Plan for Entrepreneurial Education in Secondary Schools,www.state.tn.us/ecd/busserv.htm,"Abstract: The program constitutes an expansion of a current program being offered at Austin East High School in Knoxville. The Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development has contracted with Knox County Schools, a public entity, for the services of faculty from Austin East High School to expand the program to other secondary schools in the ARC Region and to develop a ""School of Excellence in Entrepreneurship,"" modeled after the several Governor's Schools of Excellence program that has been proven successful.

Expanding the program requires several components: 1) a training and support component for teachers who will bring the course of instruction to their schools; 2) the actual course of instruction; 3) development of community business support; 4) establishment of the summer School of Excellence.

Teacher Training and Support: Entrepreneurship has not been adopted widely in the state due to a lack of training for teachers interested in adopting the program; lack of availability of satisfactory lesson plans; and a lack of ongoing program support for teachers. Portions of the grant will be used to remedy these conditions. The lesson plan (approximately 900 pages in length) is prepared and ready for duplication. Austin East faculty will recruit, train, and mentor teachers desiring to adopt the entrepreneurship course. The TN Department of Economic and Community Development, Small Business Division, will act in a supporting role, mentoring teachers and identifying and providing information resources to teachers.

Some grant funds will be used to enable teachers to network with other teachers using email and Internet Web sites. This ability to communicate easily is important, as most teachers spend their days in the classroom and are not available for telephone conferences. One barrier to increased use of the entrepreneurship course has been the lack of familiarity with the subject matter on the part of teachers. The ability to mentor teachers as they conduct their first courses is felt to be important in order to help participants develop positive teaching experiences so they will not drop entrepreneurship in favor of courses with which they are more familiar.

This effort will complement an ARC initiative, the ARC Telecommunications Initiative. Under this initiative, Austin East High School has installed videoconferencing capability.

Course Description: The course consists of formal coursework approved for credit by Tennessee Department of Education. It will be taught as an elective to juniors and seniors. The schools will use the Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management textbook approved by the State of Tennessee and currently on the textbook adoption list.

The course will cover subject matter appropriate to the operations of small businesses, areas such as marketing, sales, finance, and basic management skills. To encourage the actual development of student businesses, a venture capital fund of $50 per student will be available to each instructor. The moneys will be provided to the students in the form of a loan, with repayment of the full amount due before the end of the term.

The program will initially be expanded to five other secondary schools in two additional school districts: Blount and Sevier. Brochures, flyers, and possibly a videotape will be produced to persuade more instructors and schools to add entrepreneurship to their curricula.

Community Support: In addition to the academic emphasis, the program intends to identify and integrate school-to-career strategies and formulate partnerships with local business leaders. School-to-career initiatives can provide funding for approved activities. These partnerships will result in student mentoring by area entrepreneurs, speakers for classes and special presentations and fieldtrip opportunities. The program intends to rely upon the business community in the out-years for financial support.

Schools of Excellence: The Tennessee Board of Education operates Governor's Schools of Excellence for academically promising youths each summer. These schools cover such areas as international relations and the arts and sciences. In 1998, students from Austin East attended short camps with 4-H members. It is the grantee's intent to establish a school of excellence in entrepreneurship as a stand-alone school along the model of the existing Governor's Schools. This school will give program participants opportunities to learn in greater detail the role of entrepreneurship in the regional and national economy.

Entrepreneurship Program Expansion: The Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development will act as partner to the Knox County schools in the expansion and growth of the program. It is the intent of the department to promote the program statewide.

In addition to academic instruction, the department will seek the establishment of regional competitions where business plans and product innovations can be recognized. Eventually, the entrepreneurship program will seek designation as a Governor's School of Excellence and accept participants from across the state for the summer camp."

Entrepreneurs in Action",http://entrepreneurship.vanderbilt.edu,"Focus: Partnership between university and local schools

Abstract: Our Mission: We see entrepreneurship education as a vehicle for creating a learning environment that fosters entrepreneurial activities and develops the mindset for thinking outside of a structured setting. Such a learning environment is designed to teach students how to live and work outside of bureaucracy, learn to dream about new ideas and new ventures, to push the edge of the ""envelope,"" and to see entrepreneurship as reality. By promoting creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship, we hope to nurture a new generation of entrepreneurial thinkers.

Entrepreneurs in Action is a program currently running at the middle-school level in the southeast region of the United States. This approach to entrepreneurship education involves a number of case studies that are delivered on the Web site of the Forum for Entrepreneurship Education ( http://entrepreneurship.vanderbilt.edu) for a wide range of educational levels, from elementary through university. The cases are centered on real problems in the local community and depend on the interaction between the student and local ""online experts"" who have given of their time to insure that the students get a feel for real world decision making.

This work centers around connecting learning with the framework of the learner, while using the Internet as a content delivery system. Rather than replace a school's existing curriculum, these problem-based learning modules augment the presentation of subject areas that might formerly be kept separate, such as math, language arts, science, history, music, and art. Using an entrepreneurial problem as an overarching theme, this instructional approach involves ""whole-part-whole"" teaching and ""just in time"" learning. Presently under testing at middle schools, the same approach will be tested at the elementary and high school levels later in the year.

Accordingly, the project is expanding from the southeast to at least two additional states. Schools presently or soon to be participating in studies are from Tennessee, New York, and Louisiana. Each of the authors addresses the topic as it relates to his or her study area in each educational level. Since the project is based on the Internet, a demonstration of its features is possible if Internet connections are available."

Real Business Startup As a Class Assignment",none listed,"Focus: Community college and/or four-year college/university

Abstract: One learns about business from books and from the experiences of others. One learns business by doing it.

For more than 10 years I have required all of my Small Business Management students to write a business plan as their term project and present it to the class as their final exam. If the student currently owns and operates their own business, they write a business plan for their business. If the student does not currently own and operate a small business, he or she must start a real business and then write a business plan for their own business.

While many students are actually operating a small business without realizing that they are small business operators, others are surprised to find that the assignment is real. We divide up into small groups, and each group must answer the question ""How can one make $1,000,000 in 5 years starting with $5,000.?"" Each group has one week to develop an answer.

After we discuss what can be done, we get to the question ""What will you do?"" We then start with a discussion that leads to a definition of a small business. This is where we discover that many of the students already own and operate a small business. I get questions like ""I mow lawns to make spending money. Can I use that as my business?"" Because it is not a full-time business, they do not recognize it as a real business. Once we establish what it means to own and operate a business, we get everyone involved in some business of their own and move through the course. We start each class by asking each student to summarize their activities for the past week and their plans for the next few weeks. Suggestions and encouragements are given. This frequently turns into a group consultation session. It is positive motivation for all."

Through our program called Venture Quest, we hope to help build a base of future leaders in entrepreneurship and technology.

Abstract: A report published by the American Association of University Women, Tech-Savvy: Educating Girls in the New Computer Age found that girls are grossly underrepresented in tech careers and upper level computer classes. By targeting girls in the seventh and eighth grades, we are reaching them at a critical point when they can still be influenced and inspired to pursue high school and college courses (and ultimately selecting careers) in the high tech and life sciences fields. Through Venture Quest, girls will gain knowledge, experience, and confidence in entrepreneurship, business, and technology that will direct them into careers in math, science, and technology, thus significantly increasing the number of women entering these fields.

Teachers, executives and administrators, whose girls currently represent diverse cultures and social and economic backgrounds, will nominate the candidates for the program. Our goal would be to maximize this diversity within the Venture Quest Program.

Initially, the pilot program will support 150 young girls in the seventh grade. Candidates for the program will be sourced from EWE-Texas member CEOs and a variety of middle schools and strategic organizations, such as Girl Scouts, YWCA, Girls Inc., The Women's Museum, What Mom Never Knew and Independent Means. In the second year, the pilot program will support 150 girls in the seventh grade and 150 girls in the eighth grade.

The curriculum content for Venture Quest will be delivered through a combination of live and online edutainment programs. The curriculum content is being designed in module-based formulas so that it can be easily replicated in the form of workshops or studio programs, after school programs, school elective programs, and camps. All of the offline-live programs will be complimented by an online interactive clubroom where girls interact with each other, with guest experts and explore multidimensional rooms designed to promote individual business and leadership skills. Business skill sets that will be learned include: Entrepreneurial, Business Structures, Enterprise Management Marketing Management, Operational Management, Financial Management, and Practical Business Application. Skills gained in professional and personal growth include: Presentation Skills, Public Speaking, Articulating Ideas, Decision Making, Team Work, Creative Thinking, Organizational Skills, Taking Initiative, and Self Analysis in identifying their unique skills and strengths.

Venture Quest also aims to foster the Developmental Assets as identified in the study conducted by the Search Institute, a Minneapolis-based, nonprofit research and education organization specializing in children and youth issues. The study was conducted in cooperation with the Dallas Public Schools. More information can be found on the study at http://www.searchinstitute.org/assets.

The FWE-Texas Institute has a long-term perspective of creating a lasting, fundamental change in the girls that we serve. By utilizing computers, the Internet, and other technology mediums in our Venture Quest Program, the girls will gain permanent skills that can be used throughout their school. personal. and professional careers. Success will be measured by the following results: the number of girls who go on to high school and take the required college preparatory math and science classes; who utilize the Venture Quest Program online clubroom to continue learning and interacting; who take Advanced Placement Tests for business, technology and science; who are awarded application to Magnet High Schools for their interests and achievements in math, science and technology; who qualify as finalist in the National Business Plan Competition; who successfully raise venture funding from the investment-community."

Yet on the other hand, entrepreneurs are often the greatest victims of social, economic and political change (globalization, regulation, and consolidation). Thus, in order to succeed in the future, entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship educators must stay plugged into the evolving social context of such enterprises. This class will survey the identifiable trends and future predictions about social, technological, and geo-political change in light of future entrepreneurial opportunities and challenges. This class is only a survey and participants are expected to walk away with new ideas and questions to ponder when they return to their businesses or classrooms.

Rapid Deployment of Entrepreneurial Training on U.S.-Mexico Border",none listed,"Focus: Four-year college/university

Abstract: This is a very successful entrepreneurial training program implemented for 60 and 65 high school students in 1999 and 2000. Students developed their own real small business in just seven weeks in this program.

Math lessons were integrated into the entrepreneurial activities when the students calculated profit margins, budgets, and cost ratios for business plans and other business reports. Reading lessons were taught as the students researched products and services, read secondary data during project feasibility studies, or read technical manuals. Writing lessons were included when the students wrote business plans and marketing studies. Career guidance in business and entrepreneurism was given during business career fairs, mentor relationships, and on-site business trips.

Techniques that were implemented to ramp up and ""ramp down"" the complex entrepreneurial training in just a seven-week timeframe are important. Lessons were learned that will be helpful to other entities interested in implementing practical entrepreneurial training with extensive academic training in reading, writing, and math embedded into the small business curricula.

Abstract: This program is an exciting ""twenty-first-century venture"" focused on the development of student workforce readiness and entrepreneurship skills, and will highlight the development and implementation, which involves students, business leaders, teachers, and parents. The Student Entrepreneur Center focuses on active student and community partnerships to provide entrepreneurship opportunities. Strategies for workforce preparation, global mindset development, and increasing levels of technology literacy for students, teachers, staff, parents, and the community will be presented.

The performing and visual arts area is also a part of the center's vitality, using creative energy and innovation to launch new businesses in those areas. Academically, students engage in a curriculum that complements and dramatically extends current business course offerings.

Emphasis is on ownership, management, and other skills necessary to run a successful global enterprise. The second aspect of the center is the ""International Mercado."" The mercado is the laboratory where students apply knowledge to the ""hands-on"" experiences of running their own business. Students practice entrepreneurship as they market and sell their own products, which include arts and crafts, foodstuffs, and/or services."

Abstract: True Colors Interior Design is a School-to-Careers–based company started and operated through the interior design class at Millcreek High School. The students manufacture, package, and market lotion to a variety of schools and to individuals in town.

After attending a vocational seminar on lotion making, we thought this would be a great School-to-Careers venture for my students. I taught them the various ingredients and what the function of each ingredient was. They were instructed on how to mix ingredients and on quality control methods. They then had to formulate the ingredient proportions and determine the quality level they wanted for their lotion. They decided on scents and colors and experimented until they came up with a formula they felt good about. They chose the bottle shape and size and a name for the product (Sweet Secrets Silkening Body Lotion). The class then invited a graphic design company in to help us design our label in class and look at the various requirements and functions the label needed to perform (it had to be waterproof, etc.).

A small sample of marketing research was done to determine how much we could sell, and how much lotion we should make to begin with. Production then began. The students have taken ownership of this company from the beginning. They are excited and proud of the product they make. If asked questions about the company or the product, the students can fully answer the questions with confidence and knowledge. The success of our company and product has been overwhelming. The students have discovered they can make it as big as they are willing to go.

Unique features of the project include:

Start-up monies were from a School-to-Careers grant.
The product formula was developed and marketed by students.
The administration was against the idea at first, and didn't think we would be successful. It was only after we had the product ready to sell that they came on board. When they realized this was going to be a successful business and could see what it was doing for the students, we had their full support.
Lotion is produced in the fall and spring for a two-week period.
Students produce approximately one hundred bottles an hour."

Key Partners: Vocational Education Department, state office of education; U.S. Small Business Administration; Utah Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs); local chambers of commerce; Kauffman Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership; Centurion Bank/American Express Foundation; Larry H. Miller Foundation.

Abstract: The Center for Entrepreneurship Training (CET) provides entrepreneurial training opportunities for residences and company personnel in Salt Lake and Tooele Counties in Utah. Three-fourths of the operating funds for the center come from a grant from the state legislature. One-fourth comes from residual revenues generated from the tuition paid by students attending the training courses.

The CET also develops new curricula for courses. Jump Start Entrepreneurship for Single Parents, funded through the Kauffman Foundation, is one such course. Another is Managing Business Growth, a course curriculum funded by Zions Bank Corporation. The CET has been in operation since April 1990. Currently there are 28 courses, conferences, and workshops being offered by the CET. Course topics include free enterprise, marketing, sales, bookkeeping, financial management, and Quick Books Pro.

Francom has helped more than 800 students each year to complete training courses en route to starting and expanding small businesses. The center sponsors courses in business planning, accounting, marketing, financial management, valuation, credit repair, financing, etc. Currently more than 30 courses are offered each semester. Francom also currently gives counseling to one-third of the clients of the Sandy Small Business Development and Assistance Center. He was the primary instigator for bringing the statewide Small Business Development Center program to Salt Lake Community College, which is now the host institution for the state's 13 regional SBDCs.

The CET targets the adult learner. This determines the delivery format for the education process. Most participants are adult men and women, age 30 to 65. The overall delivery philosophy is to facilitate an activity-based forum for interactive and experiential training where the student is encouraged to participate on a 60-40 basis with the facilitator.

The CET has developed a 10-module curriculum, instructor's guide, and program guide for Jump Start Entrepreneurship for Single Parents. The CET has developed a 12-module curriculum entitled ""Managing Business Growth,"" which challenges the viability of start-up companies seeking bank SBA financing. It looks at a company from the banker's point of view.

The CET, with the aid of a $90,000 Jump Start II grant from the Kauffman Foundation, has developed a unique training program directed to and designed for single mothers. In addition, this program, as it has been observed, works very well with the economically disadvantaged of many cultures and ethnic backgrounds. This new curriculum has been used in numerous workshops, typically located at local community recreation centers and at community schools within the public school system. Approximately 400 participants, half of whom are ethnic minorities, have received the training, and 33 percent have begun businesses. The program's goal is to provide self-employment and development skills.

The purpose and content of this program are as follows:

Show by experience and example the evolution of a training program from concept stage to full-blown curriculum development and professional certified delivery.
Demonstrate the value of doing research on the demographics and psychographics of the target audience for a training program—making the difference between a high-quality program and a mediocre program.
Experience an activity from the instruction guide manual to simulate the desired classroom interaction to enable the adult learner to fully participate and thereby maximize the desire and capability to learn.
Gain an understanding of the need to select and train trainers to insure program continuity and quality and the unbiased nurturing of each student.
Portray the necessity and value of developing strategic alliances with resource partners—e.g., WorkForce Services, JTPA, State Office of Education, local housing authorities, community recreation centers, WIC centers, and city and county business licensing offices—to attain support via tuition scholarships, mentoring programs, and remedial job skill development where needed.
The CET, in partnership with Larry H. Miller, has built a 37,000-square-foot training and conference center. This center has a holding capacity of 600 people and can be divided into eight smaller rooms for conference break-out sessions. The total cost of the complex (when completed in 2006) is estimated to be $31 million. This center will contain a business incubator, a distance education center, a training hotel, a Western Governors University Service Center, a full-service financing center, and other services.

The Larry H. Miller Entrepreneurship Training Center will provide a symbolic effect as the ""lighthouse"" to show the way to those individuals struggling to start a small business. At this center, mentoring, experiential and facilitative training, a creative crucible thinking studio, and contact with the successful entrepreneur will be available."

Kiva is the world's first person-to-person micro-lending website, empowering individuals to lend directly to unique entrepreneurs in the developing world; the Grameen Foundation, Mission Statement: Grameen Foundation's mission is to empower the world's poorest people to lift themselves out of poverty with dignity through access to financial services and to information. With tiny loans, financial services and technology, we help the poor, mostly women; start self-sustaining businesses to escape poverty. Founded in 1997 by a group of friends who were inspired by the work of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, our global network of microfinance partners reaches over 4 million families in 27 countries; and other more local i.e. VIC - The Institute on the Caribbean - Vermonters doing work in Haiti and the Dominican Republic - micro lending and volunteer efforts for health care, healthy foods, education, and clean water - this group also works with Shelburne Farms in Shelburne, Vermont - doing projects on susustainability.

Students will make small micro finance loans to third world country individual entrepreneurs to help them with the purchase of their business-related items such as: a sewing machine, materials or livestock that can dramatically improve their life and their families, thus empowering them to earn their way out of poverty.
Students will follow/keep track of their micro finance loans and stay in contact with those they have financed. The intent is for the loans to be repaid so that the monies may be further loaned out to others in need.
Students will work to raise awareness of their micro-credit lending program - and also do volunteer work for others - a community service learning component.
Expected Outcomes: Students will have a real impact on helping others lives and thus learn that a small amount goes far in many places; that we all share the same world. Hopefully students will take greater pride in learning to take care of their environment, others and learn to give back to their communities."

Abstract: This school-based enterprise was established with the support of the Nickelsville Ruritan Club, the Scott County School System, the Rural Area Development Association, the Heart of Appalachia Tourism Authority, and the Virginia REAL Enterprise program. The program was established in October 2001 to teach children aged 14-21 how to own and operate their own business: a 100-year-old corn meal and flourmill at historic Bush Mill.
Six students participating in the Rural Area Development Association (a community action agency) program worked on making repairs to the millrace and the historic mill after school and on weekends. During the Christmas season, students worked with Ruritan Club members to open and promote the ""Country Mill Store"" at Bush Mill, the first attempt at a retail outlet for the corn and flour products.

In an area where community pride has been damaged by years of hard times, this project has awakened the desire to reinforce the bonds between youth, their mentors, and their home place. Civic pride is being strengthened as people, young and old, lend their talents to the creation of this enterprise. Ruritan Club volunteers worked with the youth to repair the millrace that diverts water to the huge overshot waterwheel. The four remaining millers in the area are passing on their skills to the youth as they work on the actual mill and grind corn. Old ways are combined with new ideas as the minds of these youth are opened to both the past and future through this experience. The Stay for Life Project at Bush Mill is a combination of the old and of the new. It's a combination of a 100-year-old mill and our young people. It forges a connection between them and the history of the community.

The Lonesome Pine Office on Youth provides technical support for the development of the school-based enterprise, and provides support for the REAL Enterprise youth entrepreneurship curriculum. The Nickelsville Ruritan Club is the caretaker of the mill and works with the youth providing instruction, supervision, and mentoring. The Scott County School System is beginning development of the school-based enterprise connecting Bush Mill with marketing and education efforts at Twin Springs High School. And the Heart of Appalachia Tourism Authority is providing support for promoting Bush Mill in tour books and on web sites.

In addition to creating a school-based enterprise, a historic landmark is being restored and repaired, bringing tourism and retail opportunities into the area.

Abstract: Founded in the early 1980s, REAL Enterprises' mission is to help individuals, schools, communities, and rural America grow through hands-on entrepreneurship education. REAL is committed to preparing youths and adults to be active, self-sufficient, and productive citizens and effective contributors to community and economic development by: creating and sustaining a national network of dynamic entrepreneurship educators supported by effective member organizations, providing high-quality hands-on entrepreneurship curriculum and training for K–16 educators; advocating for experiential education and entrepreneurship; and documenting REAL's effectiveness for students and teachers. REAL serves and supports schools and teachers through nonprofit national and member organizations throughout the United States, six of which serve states in the ARC service region.

How it Works: At the high school/post-secondary level, REAL guides students through the process of creating small businesses of their own design. The process includes:

self-assessment to determine students' potential and existing marketable strengths
community analysis to identify needs and trends in the local economy
researching/writing a comprehensive business plan for a student's chosen enterprise
start-up support for participants who choose to open and operate enterprises.
A community support team of entrepreneurs and others from the local community assists each local program. REAL has been successfully integrated into existing post-secondary degree/certificate programs and has demonstrated its ability to create successful businesses.
In elementary and middle schools, Mini/Middle REAL helps students explore entrepreneurship in the context of a fully functioning in-school community (with a ""Merchant's Mall,"" government, revenue, and court system), understand the economic implications of career and lifestyle choices, and apply entrepreneurial practices to school-based enterprises and community needs."

Abstract: The Purely Appalachia Craft Empowerment (PACE) program was one outcome of an intensive home-based and micro-business educational initiative begun in the early 90's by Virginia Cooperative Extension (VCE). This initiative, funded by a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) grant, was led by a group of extension agents from far southwest Virginia assisted by VCE Extension Specialists. The crafts marketing program grew out of a need to assist traditional crafters in an economically distressed region of the Appalachian Mountains with business and market development. Many families have benefited from the additional income generated through sales of their high quality crafts. The recent marketing efforts of PACE have included display and demonstration in the Daily Mail's Ideal Home Show (2000) in London, England; development of an e-commerce web site, and establishment of a gallery and retail store. PACE entrepreneurs have also been instrumental in developing and implementing a series of educational programs designed to increase the knowledge and skills of existing and/or potential craft entrepreneurs.

Phyllis Deel has helped families in Southwest Virginia develop home-based and micro businesses for over a decade. Serving as an extension agent in a region that has chronically suffered from a weak economy, high unemployment, and isolation of the mountains, she has helped families draw from their strengths. Many artisans of traditional crafts have emerged to use their creativity along with a strong work ethic to be a part of the Purely Appalachia Craft Empowerment (PACE) program. The earnings from their crafts have helped many families supplement their low to moderate income.

Jeannie M. Mullins served as coordinator for the PACE program for two years prior to her recent employment with Virginia Cooperative Extension as an extension agent in Family and Consumer Sciences. She created and managed the gallery and retail outlet for PACE crafts and was very instrumental in the development of the training and educational curricula presently offered by PACE. Jeannie has worked extensively with craft entrepreneurs in product development, marketing, and skills enhancement.

PURELY APPALACHIA CRAFT EMPOWERMENT (PACE) PROGRAM-was created as a non-profit marketing program to assist local craft entrepreneurs with business development and marketing services. Serving the coalfield counties of southwest Virginia, PACE specializes in the marketing of traditional high quality crafts. The retail outlet is located in the historic Lay's Furniture and Hardware Building in Coeburn, Virginia."

Southwest Virginia: Communities in Economic Transition: 
""The Youth Component""",none listed,"Abstract: The Communities in Economic Transition program began in 1989 with the goal of economic revitalization. Their method was to tap the best resources at hand: the youth and educational sectors. Since then, the program has grown into a multi-disciplinary project that has managed to coordinate the efforts of a number of schools, colleges, universities, and businesses. This program has addressed the issues of community development and economic security and made the major thrust of the program a collaboration of community resources.

The program goal is to face realistically the root of the youth out-migration problem and its economic impact. In doing so, Communities in Economic Transition reveals to southwestern Virginia youth the need for analytical skills, economic responsibility, and an appreciation of the values of rural life. They have an in-depth view of programs that youth have developed that have allowed them to become a part of the solution to the many problems facing young people from rural areas.

A slide program tells the story of what students say is unique to southwestern Virginia. Results of projects chosen by students that enhanced the economic potential of the region are available."

Abstract: Use of technology must be accompanied by an equally improved understanding of all other facets of business or success will be as short lived, as it was for the Dot-Comers. A strong working knowledge of accounting, management skills, marketing, basic legal aspects, human resources, advertising, sales, and of course computers, accompany an individual into business, thus improving their odds for success.

A personal evaluation of one's strengths and weaknesses must be made, for the individual to understand what skills are needed to be improved/enhanced or if the individual is even up to the task of starting his/her own business.

Having the student do a personal mission statement (like the one used by Stephen Covey) further educates the individual in what their true reason/goal, for becoming an entrepreneur, might be.

A very important ingredient is maintaining a continuous communication with the student. Chosen was a communication tool referred to as a 'Reflection Paper', as the method of communicating with each student. Even with a very interactive class one to one two way written communication further improves the student's understanding and application of new ideas. A Reflection Paper is due every week.

The text used was Essentials of ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT, by Zimmerer and Scarborough. This book comes in paperback and includes 'Business PlanPro 6.0', the most used business plan in the United States.

Each student builds his or her own business plan, using the 6.0 software. It takes anywhere from 20 to 60 hours to properly do a business plan. Building a knowledge base, evaluating individual strengths/weaknesses, the text, sharing of instructors/students experiences, guest speakers, and completing the business plan gives the student a thorough working knowledge of what it takes to become an entrepreneur/business owner."

Native Americans think about the cultural, community, and spiritual in everything they do. Business is no exception. Watching a tribal member tell his or her story about business is essential. Making this situation into a case study is the culmination of the entrepreneur's understanding and acceptance of the traditional values of running a small business."

Ongoing training provides knitters with the additional skills they need to fill orders and the advanced skills they need to become valuable players in the marketplace, as well as instructors for ABD's training program. Training is provided by ""lead"" knitters on a peer-to-peer model. ABD's production facility coordinates the work of the entrepreneurs, fills the orders, and provides the finishing, shipping, and billing functions for the network.

Abstract: Through the development of microenterprises -- small-scale businesses with five or fewer employees -- West Virginians can earn a living while remaining in their communities. The Center for Economic Options (CEO) supports microbusiness development that is culturally and ecologically sustainable and is particularly interested in demonstrating how microbusinesses help individuals and communities retain and sustain the wealth of West Virginia's natural resources.

CEO discovered that a key to helping people develop their businesses, and thus their ability to reach and maintain economic self-reliance, was linking ""just in time"" business training to specific marketing efforts. The availability of the market provides the incentive necessary for many entrepreneurs to formalize their businesses, set up accounting systems, and generally increase their business's sustainability. With this in mind, CEO developed the innovative access to markets program, Showcase West Virginia.

In October 2000, CEO opened the Showcase West Virginia retail store at the Charleston Town Center Mall to serve as a marketing incubator for some of the state's smallest enterprises. From a customer's viewpoint, Showcase West Virginia is an attractive store selling a diverse array of West Virginia-made products including specialty foods, book, music, fine art, collectibles, crafts, toys, jewelry, bath and body products, wood items, glass, clothing, and more. However, the microbusiness owners who sell through Showcase West Virginia know it is ""more than a store."" They are offered marketing training, product evaluation, and opportunities to interact with customers to receive crucial feedback on their products. Operating on a consignment basis, Showcase West Virginia is a low-risk test-market for many entrepreneurs desiring to introduce new products or product lines. In June of 2001, Showcase West Virginia expanded from its original 480 square foot space into a 3000 square foot space at the Mall, and now carries the products of 200 West Virginia businesses.

Entrepreneurs who desire business growth are offered opportunities beyond selling through the marketing incubator. The Showcase West Virginia marketing program also includes taking select business owners to wholesale and retail tradeshows. This aspect of Showcase West Virginia includes specialized training targeted for specific shows, booth design, follow-up marketing, and underwriting a portion of the cost. For many businesses, this component is an appropriate ""next step"" and a way for business owners to determine how to approach other wholesale or retail opportunities. CEO is also developing an on-line presence for Showcase West Virginia to take advantage of e-commerce opportunities.

Currently, CEO is analyzing the impact Showcase West Virginia has on the financial stability of the businesses with which it works. In the coming years, CEO will implement plans to take the program to scale, and will continue to innovate and serve West Virginia as a nationally recognized social entrepreneur."

Abstract: Owning Your Own Business"" is a program used in an Accounting I class, and was designed to provide skills and knowledge so students could develop their own small businesses. The components of this program include the selection of a business, development of a business plan, creation of a marketing strategy, budgeting and investments, advertising needs and cost, and production of a salable product. The students in this class consisted of 15 girls in the 11th and 12th grades.

The students established six businesses: Santa's Stitches (Christmas ornaments), the Gingerbread Factory (handmade desserts), Swing and String Angles (ornaments), Bunches of Punches (tin pictures), A Sure Sign of Christmas (decorations), and Cookies, Candy, and More. The businesses opened in December 2001 and had total sales of $975 and profits of $632. Of the six businesses, five operated at a profit, and one at a loss.

To receive a grade for this project, the students were required to maintain accounting records and record labor costs. They were taught payroll and tax management. Students also acquired skills in the areas of advertising strategies, cost accounting, sales, demographic research, and teamwork.

Once students determined their operating costs, they were required to find investors for their businesses. This required them to research the demand for their product, and identify important demographic information on the community, including median family income, age distribution, and employment rates in-home and outside the home. The students raised from $13 to $40 in start-up capital for each business.

Students also worked closely with local business and community leaders. Students created an advertising campaign for their businesses involving the local radio station and newspaper. Two of the six student businesses contracted production of portions of their products to local businesses. All six student businesses purchased supplies from local businesses.

WV,Riverside Elementary School,none listed,"Focus: Children in high-poverty area create their own society

Geographic Area: Rural area in the middle of Appalachian coalfields.

Age Level: Pre-kindergarten through fourth grade

Key Partners: International Industries, Title I, Learn N' Serve Grant, parents and many local businesses

Abstract: Many of the children are from fourth generation welfare families and have never seen their parents go to work. The MicroSociety provides an experience for them to create their own society. It begins with attending mini-classes on the different areas of employment in the community and the different jobs that they can hold in the MicroSociety. Students participate in simulations of the role of various jobs that they want in the government or in business. Business owners develop a business plan. And they do community service as well.

The student's first job is to attend school each day. They are paid one Riverside ""Buck"" per hour of attendance. Students can be fined for not coming to school, being late, or bad behavior. Students pay tuition, taxes, rent on their desk and also for their school supplies. Second grad students and younger can attend the student marketplace every other week where older students sell their wares and practice their jobs. Students in the lower grades have a classroom business during the last marketplace of the year.

Micro Society is not a stand alone elective program but an integrated program into the entire school day. The correlation between their society and the real society is made in social studies, language arts, math, art, and even to science.

Students are not allowed to bring any supplies from home or access any amount of money to be part of the MicroSociety. Each child, regardless of home situation, can become the most prosperous person in the MicroSociety. International Industries provides$5,000 each year to cover the supplies. Parents and local businesses have been very important in providing assistance and resources for the program.

The program gives these student hope for the future. MicroSociety makes it fun to come to school. Children learn why it is important to learn math, English, and social studies, and how they can use these skills in the ""real world."""

Abstract: The West Virginia Small Business Development Center (SBDC) includes a statewide network of 13 subcenters primarily located on college or university campuses, and further provides 41 outreach centers serviced by traveling consultants. These offices provide free confidential counseling to assist in the creation of new business, as well as the expansion of existing enterprises. Group training via workshops and seminars is also provided on a regular basis either free of charge or for a nominal fee.

A primary asset of the SBDC is its designation as a ""one-stop"" business center for existing and start-up enterprises. It can thus provide all of the preliminary information and paperwork needed to legally open a business in West Virginia, including information on licensing, taxation, insurance, recordkeeping, and employer forms for workers compensation and unemployment insurance. Services to existing businesses include cash flow analysis, expansion financing, employer tax filings, and marketing tools.

The SBDC can also assist with evaluating a business idea for feasibility and projected success. Areas of consideration include an examination of proposed products or services, potential competitors, pricing, location, marketing, and management. If outside financing is needed, SBDC staff will assist in determining the required loan amount, identifying suitable funding sources, and preparing a loan proposal or business plan. Assistance to existing businesses is also offered, such as cash flow analysis, marketing strategies, product line expansion plans, and other areas to support economic growth.

SBDC's are strategically located in most major cities throughout West Virginia. Rural areas are also serviced on a regular basis by circuit riders, who visit small cities and communities to provide clients with needed business advice.

The SBDC is a division of the West Virginia Development Office, a state agency, and is also partially funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Since 1993, the SBDC has, under Hazel Palmer's leadership, created innovative programs such as the Small Business Work Force program (which provides grants of up to $5,000 to subsidize employer cost of training workers) and the Small Business Micro-Loan and Rural Outreach Program (which provides loans of up to $10,000 per applicant business for start-up or expansion purposes) as additions to its service delivery.

WI,Herzing College,none listed,"Abstract: The Bachelor of Science Business Administration program prepares students with the necessary skills and academic knowledge for entry-level or management training positions in various business enterprises. These career opportunities may be in areas such as accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivable, business administration, sales, marketing, human resources, legal office administration, or health care management. Students may receive a degree with an emphasis in Management, Accounting, Health Care, Human Resource Management, or Legal Studies.

The Entrepreneurship course provides instruction in the theory, tools, and techniques for launching and managing entrepreneurial businesses. Topics include exploring entrepreneurial opportunities and the related ethical, legal, and regulatory environments; determining competitive advantage strategies; developing business plans; analyzing sources of funding; developing marketing strategies such as product and promotion strategies, pricing systems, and distribution channels; managing human resources, risk and insurance, and operations processes; and evaluating financial performance.

We were instrumental in assisting two female Hispanic students in researching a business idea, writing a business plan, and assisting them with acquiring funding through a local investment firm. Through this process, the students became familiar with the opportunities that are available in the business environment. The business is in its third month of operation and is establishing itself as a competitor in the marketplace.

I serve as the Advisor for the Herzing College chapter of the Future Business Leaders of America. In this role, I have advised students concerning chapter formation, fund raising, and organizing volunteers for charitable organizations. I have also advised students before the state and national competitions and, in particular, counseled students in the preparation of a business plan.

I have been instrumental in developing an online Entrepreneurship course, including development of the course template and syllabus. I researched, developed and submitted a proposal for a Diploma in Entrepreneurship that could be added to the program offerings of Herzing College. I have also sponsored a guest speaker on Entrepreneurship for the all-school Student Development Hour. I was instrumental in the evaluation and redesign of the Capstone Course for bachelor students. Many of the students taking this course develop business plans, innovative product ideas, and managed work projects. Under my mentorship, two capstone students earned the college-wide award for the best project.

WI,Logan Middle School,none listed,"Focus: 8th grade students enrolled in ""Foods and Family"" classes

Abstract: During the semester-long Foods and Family class, students are guided through an entrepreneurial unit. They invest their own money to start the company by purchasing shares. They decide what food products they will make, market, and sell. They complete market surveys, recipe test runs, price comparisons at local stores and do their own company shopping with a parent's help.

Students are in charge of all aspects of the business and need to function within the rules and limitations set by our school and administration. When the business sales have been completed, the profit (hopefully) is divided equally by shares so students see the impact of investing. Students are encouraged to designate one charity or organization to which they will donate a predetermined portion of their profit.

Each time we complete a unit in entrepreneurship I am amazed at what awesome effort I have just observed. Students who don't necessarily perform well in other academic areas can really shine win an activity like this. Student's interests and skills that I have not been aware of come to the surface. Students who feel that they don't have many choices about their 8th grade education are energized (and sometimes a little overwhelmed) with all of the choices and decisions that need to be made. Natural consequences associated with those decisions are, at times, very easy or very difficult to deal with. Problem solving and critical thinking are required. This real life experience can teach more to the students through their ""doing"" than I ever could just by ""telling""."

Abstract: Learn how elementary students are introduced to the world of work at an early age. This is a program in which an elementary school has developed an entrepreneurial program that includes a banking component. Presenters will share their successful experience in their unique elementary school banking enterprise. Based on a clearly defined community of interest and pre-determined goals, this reform model is transferable to other schools. The focus of the program is to familiarize students from low socioeconomic backgrounds with the banking process. Infusion of banking careers and classroom businesses into the curriculum created the link between school and work, preparing students for a technological world.

Learn how a bank can be developed and implemented in an elementary school. Development of a partnership with a fully working commercial bank was instrumental in the creation of this enterprise. Going from a dream to a reality is the focus. You will be amazed to see how professionally the fifth-grade students conducted and ran the First SR Bank of Silver Spring School. The entrepreneurial immersion program includes in-school employment, classroom enterprises, community business partnerships, the relationship between the Silver Spring School Entrepreneurial Immersion program and the new School-to-Work Program of the Milwaukee Public Schools, possible grants, and portfolio for success.

The Associated Bank, one of the business partners, has received a national award for this partnership initiative. Due to the success of the program at Silver Spring School, other branches have formed partnerships with additional schools in the area. Many schools in and around the state of Wisconsin have come to observe and duplicate this banking process.

The purpose of this program is to introduce students from a low socioeconomic area to the world of finance. This has been accomplished through implementation of a student-run bank using actual currency and banking skills. Check with us to learn about planning, implementing, and developing the First SR Bank of Silver Spring Elementary School.

The International Business Practice Firm",none listed,"Focus: High School, Technical/Community College, And Four-Year College/University

Abstract: The International Business Practice Firm at Casper College allows students to have virtual hands on entrepreneurial experience. The students go through all the start up activities a normal business would. Then they must market their product to the other practice firms in the US and abroad.
Why do we have an International Business Practice Firm? Worldwide educators, business people and researchers are pointing to the importance of educating and retraining individuals for a very different workplace. The American Association of School Administrators established the following list of skills essential for productive workers in the 21st century.

Interpersonal skills, including speaking, listening, and the ability to be part of a team
Ability to find information using technology
Writing skills to communicate effectively
International perspective and understanding of different cultures
Knowledge of foreign languages
Knowledge of world geography
Based on the need for change in the way teaching and learning happens, the International Business Practice Firm model provides a viable solution.

What is an International Business Practice Firm? Simply put, an international business practice firm (IBPF) is a simulated business that mirrors the real world. The IBPF is a company set up by students with the assistance of a teacher/facilitator. The ""companies"" function like ""real"" businesses- the only difference is that they cooperate with other IBPFs in a closed network. Linked by technology, each IBPF conducts all operations necessary to run a business: finance, purchasing, marketing and human resources.

How Does it Work? The IBPF operates in a closed economic network. Each IBPF simulates purchasing and/or production and sales of a specific range of goods or services in a simulated market. The ""customers"" who are buying the goods or services are the participants in the network. All ""employees"" of the IBPF receive salaries, which must be spent within the network in order to make the economic cycle function. The network of IBPFs is organized and coordinated by a central office. Mercer provides this coordination for community colleges in the United States through its Center for Simulated Business Services (CSBS). Membership in this network is the gateway to operate realistically in a growing global market involving 2800 IBPFs in Europe, Canada, Australia and Asia."
